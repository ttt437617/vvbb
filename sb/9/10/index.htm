From Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Raghu came Aja, and from Aja was born the great personality Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>SB 9.10.2</B></A>: Being prayed for by the demigods, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth Himself, directly appeared with His expansion and expansions of the expansion. Their holy names were R&#257;ma, Lakshmana, Bharata and &#346;atrughna. These celebrated incarnations thus appeared in four forms as the sons of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>SB 9.10.3</B></A>: O King Par&#299;kshit, the transcendental activities of Lord R&#257;macandra have been described by great saintly persons who have seen the truth. Because you have heard again and again about Lord R&#257;macandra, the husband of mother S&#299;t&#257;, I shall describe these activities only in brief. Please listen.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 9.10.4</B></A>: To keep the promise of His father intact, Lord R&#257;macandra immediately gave up the position of king and, accompanied by His wife, mother S&#299;t&#257;, wandered from one forest to another on His lotus feet, which were so delicate that they were unable to bear even the touch of S&#299;t&#257;'s palms. The Lord was also accompanied by Hanum&#257;n [or by another monkey, Sugr&#299;va], king of the monkeys, and by His own younger brother Lord Lakshmana, both of whom gave Him relief from the fatigue of wandering in the forest. Having cut off the nose and ears of &#346;&#363;rpanakh&#257;, thus disfiguring her, the Lord was separated from mother S&#299;t&#257;. He therefore became angry, moving His eyebrows and thus frightening the ocean, who then allowed the Lord to construct a bridge to cross the ocean. Subsequently, the Lord entered the kingdom of R&#257;vana to kill him, like a fire devouring a forest. May that Supreme Lord, R&#257;macandra, give us all protection.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 9.10.5</B></A>: In the arena of the sacrifice performed by Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra, Lord R&#257;macandra, the King of Ayodhy&#257;, killed many demons, R&#257;kshasas and uncivilized men who wandered at night in the mode of darkness. May Lord R&#257;macandra, who killed these demons in the presence of Lakshmana, be kind enough to give us protection.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6-7.htm"><B>SB 9.10.6-7</B></A>: O King, the pastimes of Lord R&#257;macandra were wonderful, like those of a baby elephant. In the assembly where mother S&#299;t&#257; was to choose her husband, in the midst of the heroes of this world, He broke the bow belonging to Lord &#346;iva. This bow was so heavy that it was carried by three hundred men, but Lord R&#257;macandra bent and strung it and broke it in the middle, just as a baby elephant breaks a stick of sugarcane. Thus the Lord achieved the hand of mother S&#299;t&#257;, who was equally as endowed with transcendental qualities of form, beauty, behavior, age and nature. Indeed, she was the goddess of fortune who constantly rests on the chest of the Lord. While returning from S&#299;t&#257;'s home after gaining her at the assembly of competitors, Lord R&#257;macandra met Para&#347;ur&#257;ma. Although Para&#347;ur&#257;ma was very proud, having rid the earth of the royal order twenty-one times, he was defeated by the Lord, who appeared to be a kshatriya of the royal order.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 9.10.8</B></A>: Carrying out the order of His father, who was bound by a promise to his wife, Lord R&#257;macandra left behind His kingdom, opulence, friends, well-wishers, residence and everything else, just as a liberated soul gives up his life, and went to the forest with S&#299;t&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 9.10.9</B></A>: While wandering in the forest, where He accepted a life of hardship, carrying His invincible bow and arrows in His hand, Lord R&#257;macandra deformed R&#257;vana's sister, who was polluted with lusty desires, by cutting off her nose and ears. He also killed her fourteen thousand R&#257;kshasa friends, headed by Khara, Tri&#347;ira and D&#363;shana.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 9.10.10</B></A>: O King Par&#299;kshit, when R&#257;vana, who had ten heads on his shoulders, heard about the beautiful and attractive features of S&#299;t&#257;, his mind was agitated by lusty desires, and he went to kidnap her. To distract Lord R&#257;macandra from His &#257;&#347;rama, R&#257;vana sent M&#257;r&#299;ca in the form of a golden deer, and when Lord R&#257;macandra saw that wonderful deer, He left His residence and followed it and finally killed it with a sharp arrow, just as Lord &#346;iva killed Daksha.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 9.10.11</B></A>: When R&#257;macandra entered the forest and Lakshmana was also absent, the worst of the R&#257;kshasas, R&#257;vana, kidnapped S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;, the daughter of the King of Videha, just as a tiger seizes unprotected sheep when the shepherd is absent. Then Lord R&#257;macandra wandered in the forest with His brother Lakshmana as if very much distressed due to separation from His wife. Thus He showed by His personal example the condition of a person attached to women.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 9.10.12</B></A>: Lord R&#257;macandra, whose lotus feet are worshiped by Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, had assumed the form of a human being. Thus He performed the funeral ceremony of Jat&#257;yu, who was killed by R&#257;vana. The Lord then killed the demon named Kabandha, and after making friends with the monkey chiefs, killing V&#257;li and arranging for the deliverance of mother S&#299;t&#257;, He went to the beach of the ocean.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 9.10.13</B></A>: After reaching the beach, Lord R&#257;macandra fasted for three days, awaiting the arrival of the ocean personified. When the ocean did not come, the Lord exhibited His pastimes of anger, and simply by His glancing over the ocean, all the living entities within it, including the crocodiles and sharks, were agitated by fear. Then the personified ocean fearfully approached Lord R&#257;macandra, taking all paraphernalia to worship Him. Falling at the Lord's lotus feet, the personified ocean spoke as follows.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 9.10.14</B></A>: O all-pervading Supreme Person, we are dull-minded and did not understand who You are, but now we understand that You are the Supreme Person, the master of the entire universe, the unchanging and original Personality of Godhead. The demigods are infatuated with the mode of goodness, the Praj&#257;patis with the mode of passion, and the lord of ghosts with the mode of ignorance, but You are the master of all these qualities.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 9.10.15</B></A>: My Lord, You may use my water as You like. Indeed, You may cross it and go to the abode of R&#257;vana, who is the great source of disturbance and crying for the three worlds. He is the son of Vi&#347;rav&#257;, but is condemned like urine. Please go kill him and thus regain Your wife, S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;. O great hero, although my water presents no impediment to Your going to La&#324;k&#257;, please construct a bridge over it to spread Your transcendental fame. Upon seeing this wonderfully uncommon deed of Your Lordship, all the great heroes and kings in the future will glorify You.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 9.10.16</B></A>: &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: After constructing a bridge over the ocean by throwing into the water the peaks of mountains whose trees and other vegetation had been shaken by the hands of great monkeys, Lord R&#257;macandra went to La&#324;k&#257; to release S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299; from the clutches of R&#257;vana. With the direction and help of Vibh&#299;shana, R&#257;vana's brother, the Lord, along with the monkey soldiers, headed by Sugr&#299;va, N&#299;la and Hanum&#257;n, entered R&#257;vana's kingdom, La&#324;k&#257;, which had previously been burnt by Hanum&#257;n.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 9.10.17</B></A>: After entering La&#324;k&#257;, the monkey soldiers, led by chiefs like Sugr&#299;va, N&#299;la and Hanum&#257;n, occupied all the sporting houses, granaries, treasuries, palace doorways, city gates, assembly houses, palace frontages and even the resting houses of the pigeons. When the city's crossroads, platforms, flags and golden waterpots on its domes were all destroyed, the entire city of La&#324;k&#257; appeared like a river disturbed by a herd of elephants.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 9.10.18</B></A>: When R&#257;vana, the master of the R&#257;kshasas, saw the disturbances created by the monkey soldiers, he called for Nikumbha, Kumbha, Dh&#363;mr&#257;ksha, Durmukha, Sur&#257;ntaka, Nar&#257;ntaka and other R&#257;kshasas and also his son Indrajit. Thereafter he called for Prahasta, Atik&#257;ya, Vikampana and finally Kumbhakarna. Then he induced all his followers to fight against the enemies.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 9.10.19</B></A>: Lord R&#257;macandra, surrounded by Lakshmana and monkey soldiers like Sugr&#299;va, Hanum&#257;n, Gandham&#257;da, N&#299;la, A&#324;gada, J&#257;mbav&#257;n and Panasa, attacked the soldiers of the R&#257;kshasas, who were fully equipped with various invincible weapons like swords, lances, bows, pr&#257;sas, rishtis, &#347;akti arrows, khadgas and tomaras.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 9.10.20</B></A>: A&#324;gada and the other commanders of the soldiers of R&#257;macandra faced the elephants, infantry, horses and chariots of the enemy and hurled against them big trees, mountain peaks, clubs and arrows. Thus the soldiers of Lord R&#257;macandra killed R&#257;vana's soldiers, who had lost all good fortune because R&#257;vana had been condemned by the anger of mother S&#299;t&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>SB 9.10.21</B></A>: Thereafter, when R&#257;vana, the king of the R&#257;kshasas, observed that his soldiers had been lost, he was extremely angry. Thus he mounted his airplane, which was decorated with flowers, and proceeded toward Lord R&#257;macandra, who sat on the effulgent chariot brought by M&#257;tali, the chariot driver of Indra. Then R&#257;vana struck Lord R&#257;macandra with sharp arrows.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>SB 9.10.22</B></A>: Lord R&#257;macandra said to R&#257;vana: You are the most abominable of the man-eaters. Indeed, you are like their stool. You resemble a dog, for as a dog steals eatables from the kitchen in the absence of the householder, in My absence you kidnapped My wife, S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;. Therefore as Yamar&#257;ja punishes sinful men, I shall also punish you. You are most abominable, sinful and shameless. Today, therefore, I, whose attempt never fails, shall punish you.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>SB 9.10.23</B></A>: After thus rebuking R&#257;vana, Lord R&#257;macandra fixed an arrow to His bow, aimed at R&#257;vana, and released the arrow, which pierced R&#257;vana's heart like a thunderbolt. Upon seeing this, R&#257;vana's followers raised a tumultuous sound, crying, "Alas! Alas! What has happened? What has happened?" as R&#257;vana, vomiting blood from his ten mouths, fell from his airplane, just as a pious man falls to earth from the heavenly planets when the results of his pious activities are exhausted.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>SB 9.10.24</B></A>: Thereafter, all the women whose husbands had fallen in the battle, headed by Mandodar&#299;, the wife of R&#257;vana, came out of La&#324;k&#257;. Continuously crying, they approached the dead bodies of R&#257;vana and the other R&#257;kshasas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm"><B>SB 9.10.25</B></A>: Striking their breasts in affliction because their husbands had been killed by the arrows of Lakshmana, the women embraced their respective husbands and cried piteously in voices appealing to everyone.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>SB 9.10.26</B></A>: O my lord, O master! You epitomized trouble for others, and therefore you were called R&#257;vana. But now that you have been defeated, we also are defeated, for without you the state of La&#324;k&#257; has been conquered by the enemy. To whom will it go for shelter?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>SB 9.10.27</B></A>: O greatly fortunate one, you came under the influence of lusty desires, and therefore you could not understand the influence of mother S&#299;t&#257;. Now, because of her curse, you have been reduced to this state, having been killed by Lord R&#257;macandra.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 9.10.28</B></A>: O pleasure of the R&#257;kshasa dynasty, because of you the state of La&#324;k&#257; and also we ourselves now have no protector. By your deeds you have made your body fit to be eaten by vultures and your soul fit to go to hell.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>SB 9.10.29</B></A>: &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: Vibh&#299;shana, the pious brother of R&#257;vana and devotee of Lord R&#257;macandra, received approval from Lord R&#257;macandra, the King of Kosala. Then he performed the prescribed funeral ceremonies for his family members to save them from the path to hell.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 9.10.30</B></A>: Thereafter, Lord R&#257;macandra found S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299; sitting in a small cottage beneath the tree named Sim&#347;ap&#257; in a forest of A&#347;oka trees. She was lean and thin, being aggrieved because of separation from Him.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 9.10.31</B></A>: Seeing His wife in that condition, Lord R&#257;macandra was very compassionate. When R&#257;macandra came before her, she was exceedingly happy to see her beloved, and her lotuslike mouth showed her joy.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>SB 9.10.32</B></A>: After giving Vibh&#299;shana the power to rule the R&#257;kshasa population of La&#324;k&#257; for the duration of one kalpa, Lord R&#257;macandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead [Bhagav&#257;n], placed S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299; on an airplane decorated with flowers and then got on the plane Himself. The period for His living in the forest having ended, the Lord returned to Ayodhy&#257;, accompanied by Hanum&#257;n, Sugr&#299;va and His brother Lakshmana.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>SB 9.10.33</B></A>: When Lord R&#257;macandra returned to His capital, Ayodhy&#257;, He was greeted on the road by the princely order, who showered His body with beautiful, fragrant flowers, while great personalities like Lord Brahm&#257; and other demigods glorified the activities of the Lord in great jubilation.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>SB 9.10.34</B></A>: Upon reaching Ayodhy&#257;, Lord R&#257;macandra heard that in His absence His brother Bharata was eating barley cooked in the urine of a cow, covering His body with the bark of trees, wearing matted locks of hair, and lying on a mattress of ku&#347;a. The most merciful Lord very much lamented this.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35-38.htm"><B>SB 9.10.35-38</B></A>: When Lord Bharata understood that Lord R&#257;macandra was returning to the capital, Ayodhy&#257;, He immediately took upon His own head Lord R&#257;macandra's wooden shoes and came out from His camp at Nandigr&#257;ma. Lord Bharata was accompanied by ministers, priests and other respectable citizens, by professional musicians vibrating pleasing musical sounds, and by learned br&#257;hmanas loudly chanting Vedic hymns. Following in the procession were chariots drawn by beautiful horses with harnesses of golden rope. These chariots were decorated by flags with golden embroidery and by other flags of various sizes and patterns. There were soldiers bedecked with golden armor, servants bearing betel nut, and many well-known and beautiful prostitutes. Many servants followed on foot, bearing an umbrella, whisks, different grades of precious jewels, and other paraphernalia befitting a royal reception. Accompanied in this way, Lord Bharata, His heart softened in ecstasy and His eyes full of tears, approached Lord R&#257;macandra and fell at His lotus feet with great ecstatic love.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39-40.htm"><B>SB 9.10.39-40</B></A>: After offering the wooden shoes before Lord R&#257;macandra, Lord Bharata stood with folded hands, His eyes full of tears, and Lord R&#257;macandra bathed Bharata with tears while embracing Him with both arms for a long time. Accompanied by mother S&#299;t&#257; and Lakshmana, Lord R&#257;macandra then offered His respectful obeisances unto the learned br&#257;hmanas and the elderly persons in the family, and all the citizens of Ayodhy&#257; offered their respectful obeisances unto the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm"><B>SB 9.10.41</B></A>: The citizens of Ayodhy&#257;, upon seeing their King return after a long absence, offered Him flower garlands, waved their upper cloths, and danced in great jubilation.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42-43.htm"><B>SB 9.10.42-43</B></A>: O King, Lord Bharata carried Lord R&#257;macandra's wooden shoes, Sugr&#299;va and Vibh&#299;shana carried a whisk and an excellent fan, Hanum&#257;n carried a white umbrella, &#346;atrughna carried a bow and two quivers, and S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299; carried a waterpot filled with water from holy places. A&#324;gada carried a sword, and J&#257;mbav&#257;n, King of the Rikshas, carried a golden shield.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm"><B>SB 9.10.44</B></A>: O King Par&#299;kshit, as the Lord sat on His airplane of flowers, with women offering Him prayers and reciters chanting about His characteristics, He appeared like the moon with the stars and planets.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="45-46.htm"><B>SB 9.10.45-46</B></A>: Thereafter, having been welcomed by His brother Bharata, Lord R&#257;macandra entered the city of Ayodhy&#257; in the midst of a festival. When He entered the palace, He offered obeisances to all the mothers, including Kaikey&#299; and the other wives of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha, and especially His own mother, Kau&#347;aly&#257;. He also offered obeisances to the spiritual preceptors, such as Vasishtha. Friends of His own age and younger friends worshiped Him, and He returned their respectful obeisances, as did Lakshmana and mother S&#299;t&#257;. In this way they all entered the palace.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm"><B>SB 9.10.47</B></A>: Upon seeing their sons, the mothers of R&#257;ma, Lakshmana, Bharata and &#346;atrughna immediately arose, like unconscious bodies returning to consciousness. The mothers placed their sons on their laps and bathed Them with tears, thus relieving themselves of the grief of long separation.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm"><B>SB 9.10.48</B></A>: The family priest or spiritual master, Vasishtha, had Lord R&#257;macandra cleanly shaved, freeing Him from His matted locks of hair. Then, with the cooperation of the elderly members of the family, he performed the bathing ceremony [abhisheka] for Lord R&#257;macandra with the water of the four seas and with other substances, just as it was performed for King Indra.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm"><B>SB 9.10.49</B></A>: Lord R&#257;macandra, fully bathed and His head clean-shaven, dressed Himself very nicely and was decorated with a garland and ornaments. Thus He shone brightly, surrounded by His brothers and wife, who were similarly dressed and ornamented.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm"><B>SB 9.10.50</B></A>: Being pleased by the full surrender and submission of Lord Bharata, Lord R&#257;macandra then accepted the throne of the state. He cared for the citizens exactly like a father, and the citizens, being fully engaged in their occupational duties of varna and &#257;&#347;rama, accepted Him as their father.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm"><B>SB 9.10.51</B></A>: Lord R&#257;macandra became King during Tret&#257;-yuga, but because of His good government, the age was like Satya-yuga. Everyone was religious and completely happy.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm"><B>SB 9.10.52</B></A>: O Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit, best of the Bharata dynasty, during the reign of Lord R&#257;macandra the forests, the rivers, the hills and mountains, the states, the seven islands and the seven seas were all favorable in supplying the necessities of life for all living beings.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="53.htm"><B>SB 9.10.53</B></A>: When Lord R&#257;macandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was the King of this world, all bodily and mental suffering, disease, old age, bereavement, lamentation, distress, fear and fatigue were completely absent. There was even no death for those who did not want it.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="54.htm"><B>SB 9.10.54</B></A>: Lord R&#257;macandra took a vow to accept only one wife and have no connection with any other women. He was a saintly king, and everything in His character was good, untinged by qualities like anger. He taught good behavior for everyone, especially for householders, in terms of varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma. Thus He taught the general public by His personal activities.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm"><B>SB 9.10.55</B></A>: Mother S&#299;t&#257; was very submissive, faithful, shy and chaste, always understanding the attitude of her husband.
