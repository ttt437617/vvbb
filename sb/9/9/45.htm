I did not want their benedictions, however, because I am interested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created everything in this material world. I am more interested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead than in all material benedictions.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>A devotee is always transcendentally situated. param drishtv&#257; nivartate: one who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no longer interested in material sense enjoyment. Even such an exalted devotee as Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja went to the forest for the sake of material benefit, but when he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he refused to accept any material benediction. He said, sv&#257;min krit&#257;rtho 'smi varam na y&#257;ce: "My dear Lord, I am fully satisfied with whatever You have given me or not given me. I have nothing to ask from You, for I am fully satisfied to be engaged in Your service." This is the mentality of a pure devotee, who does not want anything, material or spiritual, from the Personality of Godhead. Our Krishna consciousness movement is therefore called krishna-bh&#257;van&#257;mrita-sa&#324;gha, the association of persons who are simply satisfied in thoughts of Krishna. Being absorbed in thoughts of Krishna is neither expensive nor troublesome. Krishna says, man-man&#257; bhava mad-bhakto mad-y&#257;j&#299; m&#257;m namaskuru: "Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, offer obeisances and worship Me." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/34.htm">Bg. 9.34</A>) Anyone can always think of Krishna, without difficulties or obstacles. This is called krishna-bh&#257;van&#257;mrita. One who is absorbed in krishna-bh&#257;van&#257;mrita has no material benefits to ask from Krishna. Instead, such a person prays to the Lord for the benediction of being able to spread His glories all over the world. Mama janmani janman&#299;&#347;vare bhavat&#257;d bhaktir ahaituk&#299; tvayi. A Krishna conscious person does not even want to stop his cycle of birth and death. He simply prays, "I may take birth as You like, but my only prayer is that I may be engaged in Your service."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
