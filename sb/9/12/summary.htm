The members of this dynasty are descendants of Sa&#347;&#257;da, the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ikshv&#257;ku.</P><P>Following in the genealogical table of Lord R&#257;macandra's dynasty, Ku&#347;a, the Lord's son, was followed consecutively by Atithi, Nishadha, Nabha, Pundar&#299;ka, Kshemadhanv&#257;, Dev&#257;n&#299;ka, An&#299;ha, P&#257;riy&#257;tra, Balasthala, Vajran&#257;bha, Sagana and Vidhriti. These personalities ruled the world. From Vidhriti came Hiranyan&#257;bha, who later became the disciple of Jaimini and propounded the system of mystic yoga in which Y&#257;jñavalkya was initiated. Following in this dynasty were Pushpa, Dhruvasandhi, Sudar&#347;ana, Agnivarna, &#346;&#299;ghra and Maru. Maru attained full perfection in the practice of yoga, and he still lives in the village of Kal&#257;pa. At the end of this age of Kali, he will revive the dynasty of the sun-god. Next in the dynasty were Prasu&#347;ruta, Sandhi, Amarshana, Mahasv&#257;n, Vi&#347;vab&#257;hu, Prasenajit, Takshaka and Brihadbala, who was later killed by Abhimanyu. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said that these were all kings who had passed away. The future descendants of Brihadbala will be Brihadrana, &#362;rukriya, Vatsavriddha, Prativyoma, Bh&#257;nu, Div&#257;ka, Sahadeva, Brihada&#347;va, Bh&#257;num&#257;n, Prat&#299;k&#257;&#347;va, Suprat&#299;ka, Marudeva, Sunakshatra, Pushkara, Antariksha, Sutap&#257;, Amitrajit, Brihadr&#257;ja, Barhi, Kritañjaya, Ranañjaya, Sañjaya, &#346;&#257;kya, &#346;uddhoda, L&#257;&#324;gala, Prasenajit, Kshudraka, Ranaka, Suratha and Sumitra. All of them will become kings one after another. Sumitra, coming in this age of Kali, will be the last king in the Ikshv&#257;ku dynasty; after him, the dynasty will be extinguished.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../11/36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
