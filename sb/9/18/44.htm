But a son who refuses his father's order is like his father's stool.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>P&#363;ru, Yay&#257;ti's last son, immediately accepted his father's proposal, for although he was the youngest, he was very qualified. P&#363;ru thought, "I should have accepted my father's proposal before he asked, but I did not. Therefore I am not a first-class son. I am second class. But I do not wish to become the lowest type of son, who is compared to his father's stool." One Indian poet has spoken of putra and m&#363;tra. putra means "son," and m&#363;tra means "urine." Both a son and urine come from the same genitals. If a son is an obedient devotee of the Lord he is called putra, or a real son; otherwise, if he is not learned and is not a devotee, a son is nothing better than urine.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
