Thus he spoke to his guru, Vasishtha, as follows.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 9.1.17</B></A>: My lord, all of you are expert in chanting the Vedic mantras. How then has the result been opposite to the one desired? This is a matter for lamentation. There should not have been such a reversal of the results of the Vedic mantras.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 9.1.18</B></A>: You are all self-controlled, well balanced in mind, and aware of the Absolute Truth. And because of austerities and penances you are completely cleansed of all material contamination. Your words, like those of the demigods, are never baffled. Then how is it possible that your determination has failed?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 9.1.19</B></A>: The most powerful great-grandfather Vasishtha, after hearing these words of Manu, understood the discrepancy on the part of the priest. Thus he spoke as follows to the son of the sun-god.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 9.1.20</B></A>: This discrepancy in the objective is due to your priest's deviation from the original purpose. However, by my own prowess I shall give you a good son.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>SB 9.1.21</B></A>: &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: O King Par&#299;kshit, after the most famous and powerful Vasishtha made this decision, he offered prayers to the Supreme Person, Vishnu, to transform Il&#257; into a male.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>SB 9.1.22</B></A>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, being pleased with Vasishtha, gave him the benediction he desired.
