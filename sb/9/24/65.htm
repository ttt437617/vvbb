Unless one is qualified to understand Krishna, one cannot appreciate the presence of Krishna on earth. Among the Bhojas, Vrishnis, Andhakas, P&#257;ndavas and many other kings intimately related with Krishna, the intimate relationship between Krishna and the inhabitants of Vrind&#257;vana is especially to be noted. That relationship is described in this verse by the words nityotsavam na tatripur dri&#347;ibhih pibantyah. The inhabitants of Vrind&#257;vana especially, such as the cowherd boys, the cows, the calves, the gop&#299;s and Krishna's father and mother, were never fully satisfied, although they saw Krishna's beautiful features constantly. Seeing Krishna is described here as nitya-utsava, a daily festival. The inhabitants of Vrind&#257;vana saw Krishna almost every moment, but when Krishna left the village for the pasturing grounds, where He tended the cows and calves, the gop&#299;s were very much afflicted because they saw Krishna walking on the sand and thought that Krishna's lotus feet, which they dared not place on their breasts because they thought their breasts not soft enough, were being pierced by broken chips of stone. By even thinking of this, the gop&#299;s were affected, and they cried at home. These gop&#299;s, who were therefore the exalted friends of Krishna, saw Krishna constantly, but because their eyelids disturbed their vision of Krishna, the gop&#299;s condemned the creator, Lord Brahm&#257;. Therefore the beauty of Krishna, especially the beauty of His face, is described here. At the end of the Ninth Canto, in the Twenty-fourth Chapter, we find a hint of Krishna's beauty. Now we are proceeding to the Tenth Canto, which is considered Krishna's head. The entire &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;na is the embodiment of Krishna's form, and the Tenth Canto is His face. This verse gives a hint of how beautiful His face is. Krishna's smiling face, with His cheeks, His lips, the ornaments in His ears, His chewing of betel nuts &#8212; all this was minutely observed by the gop&#299;s, who thus enjoyed transcendental bliss, so much so that they were never fully satisfied to see Krishna's face, but instead condemned the creator of the body for making eyelids that obstructed their vision. The beauty of Krishna's face was therefore much more appreciated by the gop&#299;s than by His friends the cowherd boys or even by Ya&#347;od&#257; M&#257;t&#257;, who was also interested in decorating the face of Krishna.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="63-64.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="66.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
