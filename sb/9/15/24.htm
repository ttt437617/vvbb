He supplied all the necessities to worship these guests, for he possessed a k&#257;madhenu cow that was able to supply everything.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The Brahma-samhit&#257; informs us that the spiritual world, and especially the planet Goloka Vrind&#257;vana, where Krishna lives, is full of surabhi cows (surabh&#299;r abhip&#257;layantam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/29.htm">Bs. 5.29</A>]). The surabhi cow is also called k&#257;madhenu. Although Jamadagni possessed only one k&#257;madhenu, he was able to get from it everything desirable. Thus he was able to receive the King, along with the King's great number of followers, ministers, soldiers, animals and palanquin carriers. When we speak of a king, we understand that he is accompanied by many followers. Jamadagni was able to receive all the King's followers properly and feed them sumptuously with food prepared in ghee. The King was astonished at how opulent Jamadagni was because of possessing only one cow, and therefore he became envious of the great sage. This was the beginning of his offense. Para&#347;ur&#257;ma, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed K&#257;rtav&#299;ry&#257;rjuna because K&#257;rtav&#299;ry&#257;rjuna was too proud. One may possess unusual opulence in this material world, but if one becomes puffed up and acts whimsically he will be punished by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the lesson to learn from this history, in which Para&#347;ur&#257;ma became angry at K&#257;rtav&#299;ry&#257;rjuna and killed him and rid the entire world of kshatriyas twenty-one times.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
