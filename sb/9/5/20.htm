At first I thought of you as an ordinary human being and accepted your hospitality, but later I could understand, by my own intelligence, that you are the most exalted devotee of the Lord. Therefore, simply by seeing you, touching your feet and talking with you, I have been pleased and have become obliged to you.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>It is said, vaishnavera kriy&#257; mudr&#257; vijñeha n&#257; bujhaya: even a very intelligent man cannot understand the activities of a pure Vaishnava. Therefore, because Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni was a great mystic yog&#299;, he first mistook Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha for an ordinary human being and wanted to punish him. Such is the mistaken observation of a Vaishnava. When Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni was persecuted by the Sudar&#347;ana cakra, however, his intelligence developed. Therefore the word &#257;tma-medhas&#257; is used to indicate that by his personal experience he would understand how great a Vaishnava the King was. When Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni was chased by the Sudar&#347;ana cakra, he wanted to take shelter of Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, and he was even able to go to the spiritual world, meet the Personality of Godhead and talk with Him face to face, yet he was unable to be rescued from the attack of the Sudar&#347;ana cakra. Thus he could understand the influence of a Vaishnava by personal experience. Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni was certainly a great yog&#299; and a very learned br&#257;hmana, but despite his being a real yog&#299; he was unable to understand the influence of a Vaishnava. Therefore it is said, vaishnavera kriy&#257; mudr&#257; vijñeha n&#257; bujhaya: even the most learned person cannot understand the value of a Vaishnava. There is always a possibility for so-called jñ&#257;n&#299;s and yog&#299;s to be mistaken when studying the character of a Vaishnava. A Vaishnava can be understood by how much he is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in terms of his inconceivable activities.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
