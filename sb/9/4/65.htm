Thus He is the well-wisher of the br&#257;hmanas. Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni was certainly a very great br&#257;hmana, but because he was a nondevotee, he could not sacrifice everything in devotional service. Great mystic yog&#299;s are actually self-interested. The proof is that when Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni created a demon to kill Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha, the King stayed fixed in his place, praying to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and depending solely and wholly on Him, whereas when Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni was chased by the Sudar&#347;ana cakra by the supreme will of the Lord, he was so perturbed that he fled all over the world and tried to take shelter in every nook and corner of the universe. At last, in fear of his life, he approached Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was so interested in his own body that he wanted to kill the body of a Vaishnava. Therefore, he did not have very good intelligence, and how can an unintelligent person be delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The Lord certainly tries to give all protection to His devotees who have given up everything for the sake of serving Him.</P><P>Another point in this verse is that attachment to d&#257;r&#257;g&#257;ra-putr&#257;pta &#8212; home, wife, children, friendship, society and love &#8212; is not the way to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is attached to hearth and home for material pleasure cannot become a pure devotee. Sometimes a pure devotee may have a habit or attraction for wife, children and home but at the same time want to serve the Supreme Lord to the best of his ability. For such a devotee, the Lord makes a special arrangement to take away the objects of his false attachment and thus free him from attachment to wife, home, children, friends and so on. This is special mercy bestowed upon the devotee to bring him back home, back to Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="64.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="66.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
