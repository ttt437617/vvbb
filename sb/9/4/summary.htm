In N&#257;bh&#257;ga's absence, his brothers did not consider his share of the kingdom, but instead divided the property among themselves. When N&#257;bh&#257;ga returned home, his brothers bestowed upon him their father as his share, but when N&#257;bh&#257;ga went to his father and told him about the dealings of the brothers, his father informed him that this was cheating and advised him that for his livelihood he should go to the sacrificial arena and describe two mantras to be chanted there. N&#257;bh&#257;ga executed the order of his father, and thus A&#324;gir&#257; and other great saintly persons gave him all the money collected in that sacrifice. To test N&#257;bh&#257;ga, Lord &#346;iva challenged his claim to the wealth, but when Lord &#346;iva was satisfied by N&#257;bh&#257;ga's behavior, Lord &#346;iva offered him all the riches.</P><P>From N&#257;bh&#257;ga was born Ambar&#299;sha, the most powerful and celebrated devotee. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha was the emperor of the entire world, but he considered his opulence temporary. Indeed, knowing that such material opulence is the cause of downfall into conditional life, he was unattached to this opulence. He engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. This process is called yukta-vair&#257;gya, or feasible renunciation, which is quite suitable for worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha, as the emperor, was immensely opulent, he performed devotional service with great opulence, and therefore, despite his wealth, he had no attachment to his wife, children or kingdom. He constantly engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. Therefore, to say nothing of enjoying material opulence, he never desired even liberation.</P><P>Once Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha was worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vrind&#257;vana, observing the vow of Dv&#257;da&#347;&#299;. On Dv&#257;da&#347;&#299;, the day after Ek&#257;da&#347;&#299;, when he was about to break his Ek&#257;da&#347;&#299; fast, the great mystic yog&#299; Durv&#257;s&#257; appeared in his house and became his guest. King Ambar&#299;sha respectfully received Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, and Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, after accepting his invitation to eat there, went to bathe in the Yamun&#257; River at noontime. Because he was absorbed in sam&#257;dhi, he did not come back very soon. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha, however, upon seeing that the time to break the fast was passing, drank a little water, in accordance with the advice of learned br&#257;hmanas, just to observe the formality of breaking the fast. By mystic power, Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni could understand that this had happened, and he was very angry. When he returned he began to chastise Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha, but he was not satisfied, and finally he created from his hair a demon appearing like the fire of death. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is always the protector of His devotee, and to protect Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha, He sent His disc, the Sudar&#347;ana cakra, which immediately vanquished the fiery demon and then pursued Durv&#257;s&#257;, who was so envious of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha. Durv&#257;s&#257; fled to Brahmaloka, &#346;ivaloka and all the other higher planets, but he could not protect himself from the wrath of the Sudar&#347;ana cakra. Finally he went to the spiritual world and surrendered to Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana, but Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana could not excuse a person who had offended a Vaishnava. To be excused from such an offense, one must submit to the Vaishnava whom he has offended. There is no other way to be excused. Thus Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana advised Durv&#257;s&#257; to return to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha and beg his pardon.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../3/36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
