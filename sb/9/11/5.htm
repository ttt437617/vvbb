Thus with melted hearts they returned all the property received from Him and spoke as follows.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In the previous chapter it was said that the praj&#257;s, the citizens, strictly followed the system of varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma. The br&#257;hmanas acted exactly like br&#257;hmanas, the kshatriyas exactly like kshatriyas, and so on. Therefore, when Lord R&#257;macandra gave everything in charity to the br&#257;hmanas, the br&#257;hmanas, being qualified, wisely considered that br&#257;hmanas are not meant to possess property to make a profit from it. The qualifications of a br&#257;hmana are given in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/42.htm">18.42</A>):.</P><P>&#347;amo damas tapah &#347;aucam</P><P CLASS=n>ksh&#257;ntir &#257;rjavam eva ca</P><P CLASS=n>jñ&#257;nam vijñ&#257;nam &#257;stikyam</P><P CLASS=n>brahma-karma svabh&#257;vajam</P><P>"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness &#8212; these are the qualities by which the br&#257;hmanas work." The brahminical character offers no scope for possessing land and ruling citizens; these are the duties of a kshatriya. Therefore, although the br&#257;hmanas did not refuse Lord R&#257;macandra's gift, after accepting it they returned it to the King. The br&#257;hmanas were so pleased with Lord R&#257;macandra's affection toward them that their hearts melted. They saw that Lord R&#257;macandra, aside from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was fully qualified as a kshatriya and was exemplary in character. One of the qualifications of a kshatriya is to be charitable. A kshatriya, or ruler, levies taxes upon the citizens not for his personal sense gratification but to give charity in suitable cases. D&#257;nam &#299;&#347;vara-bh&#257;vah. On one hand, kshatriyas have the propensity to rule, but on the other they are very liberal with charity. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira gave charity, he engaged Karna to take charge of distributing it. Karna was very famous as D&#257;t&#257; Karna. The word d&#257;t&#257; refers to one who gives charity very liberally. The kings always kept a large quantity of food grains in stock, and whenever there was any scarcity of grains, they would distribute grains in charity. A kshatriya's duty is to give charity, and a br&#257;hmana's duty is to accept charity, but not more than needed to maintain body and soul together. Therefore, when the br&#257;hmanas were given so much land by Lord R&#257;macandra, they returned it to Him and were not greedy.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
