Then He entered His own abode, the Vaikuntha planet beyond the brahmajyoti.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The lotus feet of the Lord are always a subject matter for meditation for devotees. Sometimes when Lord R&#257;macandra wandered in the forest of Dandak&#257;ranya, thorns pricked His lotus feet. The devotees, upon thinking of this, would faint. The Lord does not feel pain or pleasure from any action or reaction of this material world, but the devotees cannot tolerate even the pricking of the Lord's lotus feet by a thorn. This was the attitude of the gop&#299;s when they thought of Krishna wandering in the forest, with pebbles and grains of sand pricking His lotus feet. This tribulation in the heart of a devotee cannot be understood by karm&#299;s, jñ&#257;n&#299;s or yog&#299;s. The devotees, who could not tolerate even thinking of the Lord's lotus feet being pricked by a thorn, were again put into tribulation by thinking of the Lord's disappearance, for the Lord had to return to His abode after finishing His pastimes in this material world.</P><P>The word &#257;tma-jyotih is significant. The brahmajyoti, which is greatly appreciated by jñ&#257;n&#299;s, or monistic philosophers who desire to enter it for liberation, is nothing but the rays of the Lord's body.</P><P>yasya prabh&#257; prabhavato jagad-anda-koti-</P><P CLASS=n>kotishv a&#347;esha-vasudh&#257;di-vibh&#363;ti-bhinnam</P><P CLASS=n>tad brahma nishkalam anantam a&#347;esha-bh&#363;tam</P><P CLASS=n>govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi</P><P>"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes." (Brahma-samhit&#257; <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/40.htm">5.40</A>) The brahmajyoti is the beginning of the spiritual world, and beyond the brahmajyoti are the Vaikuntha planets. In other words, the brahmajyoti stays outside the Vaikuntha planets, just as the sunshine stays outside the sun. To enter the sun planet, one must go through the sunshine. Similarly, when the Lord or His devotees enter the Vaikuntha planets, they go through the brahmajyoti. The jñ&#257;n&#299;s, or monistic philosophers, because of their impersonal conception of the Lord, cannot enter the Vaikuntha planets, but they also cannot stay eternally in the brahmajyoti. Thus after some time they fall again to this material world. &#256;ruhya kricchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'n&#257;drita-yushmad-a&#324;ghrayah (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/10/2/32.htm">10.2.32</A>). The Vaikuntha planets are covered by the brahmajyoti, and therefore one cannot properly understand what those Vaikuntha planets are unless one is a pure devotee.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
