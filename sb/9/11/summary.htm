He gave them the eastern, western, northern and southern directions respectively, and the balance He gave to the &#257;c&#257;rya. Lord R&#257;macandra's faith in the br&#257;hmanas and affection for His servants was observed by all the br&#257;hmanas, who then offered their prayers to the Lord and returned whatever they had taken from Him. They regarded the enlightenment given to them by the Lord within the core of their hearts as a sufficient contribution. Lord R&#257;macandra subsequently dressed Himself like an ordinary person and began wandering within the capital to understand what impression the citizens had of Him. By chance, one night He heard a man talking to his wife, who had gone to another man's house. In the course of rebuking his wife, the man spoke suspiciously of the character of S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;. The Lord immediately returned home, and, fearing such rumors, He superficially decided to give up S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;'s company. Thus He banished S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;, who was pregnant, to the shelter of V&#257;lm&#299;ki Muni, where she gave birth to twin sons, named Lava and Ku&#347;a. In Ayodhy&#257;, Lakshmana begot two sons named A&#324;gada and Citraketu, Bharata begot two sons named Taksha and Pushkala, and &#346;atrughna begot two sons named Sub&#257;hu and &#346;rutasena. When Bharata went out to conquer various lands on behalf of the emperor, Lord R&#257;macandra, He fought many millions of Gandharvas. By killing them in the fight, He acquired immense wealth, which He then brought home. &#346;atrughna killed a demon named Lavana at Madhuvana and thus established the capital of Mathur&#257;. Meanwhile, S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299; placed her two sons in the care of V&#257;lm&#299;ki Muni and then entered into the earth. Upon hearing of this, Lord R&#257;macandra was very much aggrieved, and thus He performed sacrifices for thirteen thousand years. After describing the pastimes of Lord R&#257;macandra's disappearance and establishing that the Lord appears for His pastimes only, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; ends this chapter by describing the results of hearing about the activities of Lord R&#257;macandra and by describing how the Lord protected His citizens and displayed affection for His brothers.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../10/55.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
