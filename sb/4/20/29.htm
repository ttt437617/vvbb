O my Lord, there is no reason for the liberated souls to take shelter at Your lotus feet except that such souls are constantly thinking of Your feet.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The karm&#299;s are generally engaged in fruitive activities for material bodily comforts. The jñ&#257;n&#299;s, however, are disgusted with searching after material comforts. They understand that they have nothing to do with this material world, being spirit souls. After self-realization, the jñ&#257;n&#299;s who are actually mature in their knowledge must surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (bah&#363;n&#257;m janman&#257;m ante [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/19.htm">Bg. 7.19</A>]). Self-realization is not complete unless one comes to the devotional platform. Therefore it is stated in the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam that those who are &#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma, self-satisfied, are freed from all contaminations of the material modes of nature. As long as one is affected by the modes of material nature, especially by rajas and tamas, he will be very greedy and lusty and will therefore engage in hard tasks, laboring all day and night. Such false egoism carries one from one species of life into another perpetually, and there is no rest in any species of life. The jñ&#257;n&#299; understands this fact and therefore ceases to work and takes to karma-sanny&#257;sa.</P><P>Yet this is not actually the platform of satisfaction. After self-realization, the material wisdom of the jñ&#257;n&#299; leads him to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. Then he is satisfied only in contemplating the lotus feet of the Lord constantly. Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore concluded that liberated persons taking to the devotional path have acquired the ultimate goal of life. If liberation were the end in itself, there would be no question of a liberated person's taking to devotional service. In other words, the transcendental bliss derived from self-realization, known as &#257;tm&#257;nanda, is very insignificant in the presence of the bliss derived from devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord. Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore concluded that he would simply hear of the glories of the Lord constantly and thus engage his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
