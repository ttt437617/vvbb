Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prithu, wiping the tears from his eyes, tried to look upon the Lord, but it appeared that the King was not fully satisfied by looking at Him. Thus the King offered the following prayers.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The significant point in this verse is that the Lord was standing above the ground, almost touching it. The residents of the upper planetary systems, beginning from Brahmaloka (the planet where Lord Brahm&#257; lives) down to Svargaloka (the heavenly planet of Indra), are so advanced in spiritual life that when they come to visit this or similar other lower planetary systems, they keep their weightlessness. This means that they can stand without touching the ground. Lord Vishnu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because He lives in one of the planetary systems within this universe, He sometimes plays as if one of the demigods of this universe. When He first appeared before Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, He was not touching the ground of this earth, but when He was fully satisfied with the behavior and character of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prithu, He immediately acted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead N&#257;r&#257;yana from Vaikuntha. Out of affection for Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, He touched the earth, but He rested the front of His hand on the raised shoulder of Garuda, His carrier, as if to prevent Himself from falling down, since the Lord is not accustomed to stand on earthly ground. These are all symptoms of His great affection for Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. perceiving his fortunate position, Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could not fully look upon the Lord due to ecstasy, but still, in a faltering voice, he began to offer prayers.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
