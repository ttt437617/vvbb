An advanced human being is never malicious to others. Those with advanced intelligence are always conscious that this material body is different from the soul.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In daily life we find that when a madman commits murder, he is excused even by a high-court judge. The idea is that a living entity is always pure because he is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When he falls into the clutches of material energy, he becomes a victim of the three modes of material nature. Indeed, whatever he does, he does under the influence of material nature. As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/5/14.htm">5.14</A>):</P><P>na kartritvam na karm&#257;ni</P><P CLASS=n>lokasya srijati prabhuh</P><P CLASS=n>na karma-phala-samyogam</P><P CLASS=n>svabh&#257;vas tu pravartate</P><P>"The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities, nor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action. All this is enacted by the modes of material nature."</P><P>Actually the living entity, or soul, does not do anything; everything is done under the influence of the modes of material nature. When a man is diseased, the symptoms of the disease become a source of all kinds of pain. Those who are advanced in transcendental consciousness, or Krishna consciousness, are never envious, neither of the soul nor of the activities of the soul under the influence of material nature. Advanced transcendentalists are called sudhiyah. Sudh&#299; means "intelligence," sudh&#299; means "highly advanced," and sudh&#299; means "devotee." One who is both devoted and highly advanced in intelligence does not take action against the soul or the body. If there is any discrepancy, he forgives. It is said that forgiveness is a quality of those who are advancing in spiritual knowledge.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
