When a living entity falls down to the material world, however, he has to accept a material body, and therefore, in his material embodiment, he cannot be called acyuta. Because he falls down from his real engagement in the service of the Lord, the living entity gets a material body to suffer or try to enjoy in the miserable material conditions of life. Therefore the fallen living entity is cyuta, whereas the Lord is called acyuta. The Lord was attractive for everyone &#8212; not only the King but also the priestly order, who were very much addicted to the performance of Vedic rituals. Because the Lord is all-attractive, He is called Krishna, or "one who attracts everyone." The Lord appeared in the sacrificial arena of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prithu as Ksh&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu, who is a plenary expansion of Lord Krishna. He is the second incarnation from K&#257;ranodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu, who is the origin of material creation and who expands as Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu, who then enters into each and every universe. Ksh&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu is one of the purushas who control the material modes of nature.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="35-36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
