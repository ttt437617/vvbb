The appearance of all these takes place consecutively. Similarly, in the Supreme Absolute, the modes of passion, darkness and goodness appear as consecutive energies. Sometimes they appear, and sometimes they disappear.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Darkness, illumination and clouds sometimes appear and sometimes disappear, but even when they have disappeared, the potency is still there, always existing. In the sky sometimes we see clouds, sometimes rainfall and sometimes snow. Sometimes we see night, sometimes day, sometimes illumination and sometimes darkness. All these exist due to the sun, but the sun is unaffected by all these changes. Similarly, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original cause of the total cosmic manifestation, He is unaffected by the material existence. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/4.htm">7.4</A>):</P><P>bh&#363;mir &#257;po 'nalo v&#257;yuh</P><P CLASS=n>kham mano buddhir eva ca</P><P CLASS=n>aha&#324;k&#257;ra it&#299;yam me</P><P CLASS=n>bhinn&#257; prakritir ashtadh&#257;</P><P>"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego &#8212; all together these eight comprise My separated material energies."</P><P>Although the material, or physical, elements are the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are separate. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore not affected by material conditions. The Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra confirms, janm&#257;dy asya yatah: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/1/1.htm">SB 1.1.1</A>] the creation, maintenance and dissolution of this cosmic manifestation are due to the existence of the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless, the Lord is unaffected by all these changes in the material elements. This is indicated by the word prav&#257;ha ("emanation"). The sun always shines brilliantly and is not affected by clouds or darkness. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always present in His spiritual energy and is not affected by the material emanations. Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/1.htm">5.1</A>) confirms:</P><P>&#299;&#347;varah paramah krishnah</P><P CLASS=n>sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigrahah</P><P CLASS=n>an&#257;dir &#257;dir govindah</P><P CLASS=n>sarva-k&#257;rana-k&#257;ranam</P><P>"Krishna, who is known as Govinda, is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, and He is the prime cause of all causes." Although He is the supreme cause, the cause of all causes, He is still parama, transcendental, and His form is sac-cid-&#257;nanda, eternal, spiritual bliss. Krishna is the shelter of everything, and this is the verdict of all scripture. Krishna is the remote cause, and material nature is the immediate cause of the cosmic manifestation. In the Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita it is said that understanding prakriti, or nature, to be the cause of everything is like understanding the nipples on the neck of a goat to be the cause of milk. Material nature is the immediate cause of the cosmic manifestation, but the original cause is N&#257;r&#257;yana, Krishna. Sometimes people think that the cause of an earthen pot is the earth. We see on a potter's wheel a sufficient amount of earth to produce many pots, and although unintelligent men will say that the earth on the wheel is the cause of the pot, those who are actually advanced will find that the original cause is the potter, who supplies the earth and moves the wheel. Material nature may be a helping factor in the creation of this cosmic manifestation, but it is not the ultimate cause. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/10.htm">9.10</A>) the Lord therefore says:</P><P>may&#257;dhyakshena prakritih</P><P CLASS=n>s&#363;yate sa-car&#257;caram</P><P>"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt&#299;, and producing all moving and unmoving beings."</P><P>The Supreme Lord casts His glance over material energy, and His glance agitates the three modes of nature. Creation then takes place. The conclusion is that nature is not the cause of the material manifestation. The Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
