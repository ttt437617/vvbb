In other words, such a person also returns home to the Vaikuntha planets, back to Godhead.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In the execution of devotional service, &#347;ravanam k&#299;rtanam vishnoh [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../7/5/23.htm">SB 7.5.23</A>] is especially stressed. This means that bhakti, or devotional service, begins by hearing and chanting about Vishnu. When we speak of Vishnu, we also refer to that which relates to Vishnu. In the &#346;iva Pur&#257;na, Lord &#346;iva recommends Vishnu worship to be the topmost worship, and better than Vishnu worship is worship of the Vaishnava or anything that is related to Vishnu. The fact is explained herein that hearing and chanting about a Vaishnava is as good as hearing and chanting about Vishnu, for Maitreya has explained that anyone who hears about Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja with attention also attains the planet which Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prithu attained. There is no duality between Vishnu and the Vaishnava, and this is called advaya-jñ&#257;na. A Vaishnava is as important as Vishnu, and therefore &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura wrote in his Gurv-ashtaka:</P><P>s&#257;ksh&#257;d-dharitvena samasta-&#347;&#257;strair</P><P CLASS=n>uktas tath&#257; bh&#257;vyata eva sadbhih</P><P CLASS=n>kintu prabhor yah priya eva tasya</P><P CLASS=n>vande guroh &#347;r&#299;-caran&#257;ravindam **</P><P>"The spiritual master is honored as much as the Supreme Lord because he is the most confidential servitor of the Lord. This is acknowledged in all revealed scriptures and is followed by all authorities. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master, who is a bona fide representative of &#346;r&#299; Hari."</P><P>The supreme Vaishnava is the spiritual master, and he is nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said that sometimes Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu used to chant the names of the gop&#299;s. Some of the Lord's students tried to advise Him to chant the name of Krishna instead, but upon hearing this Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu became very angry with His students. The controversy on this subject reached a point that after this incident Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu decided to take sanny&#257;sa because He was not taken very seriously in His grihastha-&#257;&#347;rama. The point is that since &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu chanted the names of the gop&#299;s, worship of the gop&#299;s or the devotees of the Lord is as good as devotional service rendered directly to the Lord. It is also stated by the Lord Himself that devotional service to His devotees is better than service offered directly to Him. Sometimes the sahajiy&#257; class of devotees are interested only in Krishna's personal pastimes to the exclusion of the activities of the devotees. This type of devotee is not on a very high level; one who sees the devotee and the Lord on the same level has further progressed.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
