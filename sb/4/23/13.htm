In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/8/6.htm">8.6</A>) it is also confirmed: yam yam v&#257;pi smaran bh&#257;vam tyajaty ante kalevaram/ tam tam evaiti kaunteya sad&#257; tad-bh&#257;va-bh&#257;vitah. Those who are practicing Krishna consciousness know that their examination will be held at the time of death. If one can remember Krishna at death, he is immediately transferred to Goloka Vrind&#257;vana, or Krishnaloka, and thus his life becomes successful. Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, by the grace of Krishna, could understand that the end of his life was near, and thus he became very jubilant and proceeded to completely give up his body on the brahma-bh&#363;ta stage by practicing the yogic process. It is thoroughly described in the following verses how one can voluntarily give up this body and return home, back to Godhead. The yogic process practiced by Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja at the time of death accelerates the giving up of this body while one is in sound health physically and mentally. Every devotee desires to give up the body while it is sound physically and mentally. This desire was also expressed by King Kula&#347;ekhara in his Mukunda-m&#257;l&#257;-stotra:</P><P>krishna tvad&#299;ya-padapa&#324;kaja-pañjar&#257;ntam</P><P CLASS=n>adyaiva me vi&#347;atu m&#257;nasa-r&#257;ja-hamsah</P><P CLASS=n>pr&#257;na-pray&#257;na-samaye kapha-v&#257;ta-pittaih</P><P CLASS=n>kanth&#257;varodhana-vidhau smaranam kutas te</P><P>King Kula&#347;ekhara wanted to give up his body while in a healthy state, and he thus prayed to Krishna to let him die immediately while he was in good health and while his mind was sound. When a man dies, he is generally overpowered by mucus and bile, and thus he chokes. Since it is very difficult to vibrate any sound while choking, it is simply by Krishna's grace that one can chant Hare Krishna at the time of death. However, by situating oneself in the mukt&#257;sana position, a yog&#299; can immediately give up his body and go to whatever planet he desires. A perfect yog&#299; can give up his body whenever he desires through the practice of yoga.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
