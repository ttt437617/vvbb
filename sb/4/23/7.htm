All this he did for the satisfaction of Krishna. He had no other purpose.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In Kali-yuga the following is recommended:</P><P>harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma</P><P CLASS=n>harer n&#257;maiva kevalam</P><P CLASS=n>kalau n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva</P><P CLASS=n>n&#257;sty eva gatir anyath&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>[<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/adi/17/21.htm">Adi 17.21</A>]</P><P>In order to be recognized by Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should chant the holy name of the Lord continuously, twenty-four hours a day. Unfortunate persons who cannot accept this formula prefer to execute some type of pseudomeditation, without accepting the other processes of austerity. The fact is, however, that one must accept either the severe method of austerity described above to become purified or take to the process of devotional service recommended for pleasing the Supreme Lord, Krishna. The person who is Krishna conscious is most intelligent because in Kali-yuga it is not at all possible to undergo such severe austerities. We need only follow great personalities like Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. In His &#346;iksh&#257;shtaka, Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu wrote, param vijayate &#347;r&#299;-krishna-sa&#324;k&#299;rtanam: all glories to the holy names of Lord Krishna, which from the very beginning purify the heart and immediately liberate one. Bhava-mah&#257;-d&#257;v&#257;gni-nirv&#257;panam. If the real purpose of all yoga is to please Lord Krishna, then this simple bhakti-yoga system recommended for this age is sufficient. It is necessary, however, to engage constantly in the service of the Lord. Although Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja executed his austerities long before the appearance of Lord Krishna on this planet, his purpose was still to please Krishna.</P><P>There are many fools who claim that worship of Krishna began only about five thousand years ago, after the appearance of Lord Krishna in India, but this is not a fact. Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja worshiped Krishna millions of years ago, for Prithu happened to be a descendant of the family of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dhruva, who reigned for thirty-six thousand years during the Satya-yuga age. Unless his total life-span was one hundred thousand years, how could Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja reign over the world for thirty-six thousand years? The point is that Krishna worship existed at the beginning of creation and has continued to exist throughout Satya-yuga, Tret&#257;-yuga and Dv&#257;para-yuga, and now it is continuing in Kali-yuga. As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, Krishna appears not only in this millennium of Brahm&#257;'s life, but in every millennium. Therefore worship of Krishna is conducted in all millenniums. It is not that Krishna worship began only when Krishna appeared on this planet five thousand years ago. This is a foolish conclusion that is not substantiated by Vedic literatures.</P><P>Also of significance in this verse are the words &#257;rir&#257;dhayishuh krishnam acarat tapa uttamam. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prithu underwent severe types of austerities for the express purpose of worshiping Krishna. Krishna is so kind, especially in this age, that He appears in the transcendental vibration of His holy name. As is said in the N&#257;rada-pañcar&#257;tra, &#257;r&#257;dhito yadi haris tapas&#257; tatah kim. If Krishna is worshiped, if He is the goal of advancement, there is no need for one to execute severe types of tapasya, because one has already reached his destination. If, after executing all types of tapasya, one cannot reach Krishna, all his tapasya has no value, for without Krishna all austerity is simply wasted labor. &#346;rama eva hi kevalam (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/2/8.htm">1.2.8</A>). We should therefore not be discouraged just because we cannot go to the forest and practice severe austerities. Our life is so short that we must strictly adhere to the principles laid down by the Vaishnava &#257;c&#257;ryas and peacefully execute Krishna consciousness. There is no need to become despondent. Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura recommends: &#257;nande bala hari, bhaja vrind&#257;vana, &#347;ri-guru-vaishnava-pade maj&#257;iy&#257; mana. For a transcendental, blissful life, chant the Hare Krishna mantra, come worship the holy place of Vrind&#257;vana, and always engage in the service of the Lord, of the spiritual master and of the Vaishnavas. This Krishna consciousness movement is therefore very safe and easy. We have only to execute the order of the Lord and fully surrender unto Him. We have only to execute the order of the spiritual master, preach Krishna consciousness and follow in the path of the Vaishnavas. The spiritual master represents both Lord Krishna and the Vaishnavas; therefore by following the instructions of the spiritual master and by chanting Hare Krishna, everything will be all right.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
