You and Lord Vishnu never neglect even useless, unqualified br&#257;hmanas. Why, then, should you neglect me, who am engaged in performing sacrifices?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Although Daksha felt defeated, he knew that his punishment was simply the great mercy of Lord &#346;iva. He remembered that Lord &#346;iva and Lord Vishnu are never neglectful of the br&#257;hmanas, even though the br&#257;hmanas are sometimes unqualified. According to Vedic civilization, a descendant of a br&#257;hmana family should never be heavily punished. This was exemplified in Arjuna's treatment of A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;. A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; was the son of a great br&#257;hmana, Dron&#257;c&#257;rya, and in spite of his having committed the great offense of killing all the sleeping sons of the P&#257;ndavas, for which he was condemned even by Lord Krishna, Arjuna excused him by not killing him because he happened to be the son of a br&#257;hmana. The word brahma-bandhushu used here is significant. Brahma-bandhu means a person who is born of a br&#257;hmana father but whose activities are not up to the standard of the br&#257;hmanas. Such a person is not a br&#257;hmana but a brahma-bandhu. Daksha proved himself to be a brahma-bandhu. He was born of a great br&#257;hmana father, Lord Brahm&#257;, but his treatment of Lord &#346;iva was not exactly brahminical; therefore he admitted that he was not a perfect br&#257;hmana. Lord &#346;iva and Lord Vishnu, however, are affectionate even to an imperfect br&#257;hmana. Lord &#346;iva punished Daksha not as one does his enemy; rather, he punished Daksha just to bring him to his senses, so that he would know that he had done wrong. Daksha could understand this, and he acknowledged the great mercy of Lord Krishna and Lord &#346;iva towards the fallen br&#257;hmanas, including even himself. Although he was fallen, his vow was to execute the sacrifice, as is the duty of br&#257;hmanas, and thus he began his prayers to Lord &#346;iva.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
