You are the offering of clarified butter, You are the fire, You are the chanting of Vedic hymns by which the sacrifice is conducted, You are the fuel, You are the flame, You are the ku&#347;a grass, and You are the sacrificial pots. You are the priests who perform the yajña, You are the demigods headed by Indra, and You are the sacrificial animal. Everything that is sacrificed is You or Your energy.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In this statement Lord Vishnu's all-pervasiveness is partially explained. It is said in the Vishnu Pur&#257;na that as a fire situated in one place emanates its heat and illumination everywhere, so whatever we see within the material or spiritual worlds is nothing but a manifestation of different energies emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The br&#257;hmanas' statement is that Lord Vishnu is everything &#8212; the fire, the offering, the clarified butter, the utensils, the place of sacrifice and the ku&#347;a. He is everything. It is confirmed herein that the performance of sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-yajña in this age is as good as all other yajñas in all other ages. If one performs sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-yajña by chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare, there is no need to arrange elaborate paraphernalia for the prescribed sacrificial ceremonies recommended in the Vedas. In the chant of the holy names, Hare and Krishna, Hare means the energy of Krishna, and Krishna is the vishnu-tattva. Combined together they are everything. In this age, persons are harassed by the influence of Kali-yuga and cannot arrange for all the requisite paraphernalia for performing sacrifice as recommended in the Vedas. But if one simply chants Hare Krishna, it is to be understood that he is performing all kinds of yajña because there is nothing within our vision except Hare (the energy of Krishna) and Krishna. There is no difference between Krishna and His energies. Thus since everything is a manifestation of His energy, it is to be understood that everything is Krishna. One simply has to accept everything in Krishna consciousness, and he is a liberated person. One should not misunderstand that because everything is Krishna, Krishna has no personal identity. Krishna is so full that in spite of keeping Himself separate from everything by His energy, He is everything. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, Ninth Chapter. He is spread throughout the creation as everything, but still He is not everything. The philosophy recommended by Lord Caitanya is that He is simultaneously one and different.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
