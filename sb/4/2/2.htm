He is the greatest among the demigods. How is it possible that Daksha could be inimical towards such an auspicious personality?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Lord &#346;iva is described here as car&#257;cara-guru, the spiritual master of all animate and inanimate objects. He is sometimes known as Bh&#363;tan&#257;tha, which means "the worshipable deity of the dull-headed." Bh&#363;ta is also sometimes taken to indicate the ghosts. Lord &#346;iva takes charge of reforming persons who are ghosts and demons, not to speak of others, who are godly; therefore he is the spiritual master of everyone, both the dull and demoniac and the highly learned Vaishnavas. It is also stated, vaishnav&#257;n&#257;m yath&#257; &#347;ambhuh: &#346;ambhu, Lord &#346;iva, is the greatest of all Vaishnavas. On one hand he is the worshipable object of the dull demons, and on the other he is the best of all Vaishnavas, or devotees, and he has a samprad&#257;ya called the Rudra-samprad&#257;ya. Even if he is an enemy or is sometimes angry, such a personality cannot be the object of envy, so Vidura, in astonishment, asked why he was taken as such, especially by Daksha. Daksha is also not an ordinary person. He is a Praj&#257;pati, in charge of fathering population, and all his daughters are highly elevated, especially Sati. The word sat&#299; means "the most chaste." Whenever there is consideration of chastity, Sati, this wife of Lord &#346;iva and daughter of Daksha, is considered first. Vidura, therefore, was astonished. "Daksha is such a great man," he thought, "and is the father of Sati. And Lord &#346;iva is the spiritual master of everyone. How then could there possibly be so much enmity between them that Sati, the most chaste goddess, could give up her body because of their quarrel?"</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
