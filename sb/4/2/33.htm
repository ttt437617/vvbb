Not saying anything, he left the arena of the sacrifice, followed by his disciples.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Here Lord &#346;iva's excellent character is described. In spite of the cursing and countercursing between the parties of Daksha and &#346;iva, because he is the greatest Vaishnava he was so sober that he did not say anything. A Vaishnava is always tolerant, and Lord &#346;iva is considered the topmost Vaishnava, so his character, as shown in this scene, is excellent. He became morose because he knew that these people, both his men and Daksha's, were unnecessarily cursing and countercursing one another, without any interest in spiritual life. From his point of view, he did not see anyone as lower or higher, because he is a Vaishnava. As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/5/18.htm">5.18</A>), pandit&#257;h sama-dar&#347;inah: one who is perfectly learned does not see anyone as lesser or greater, because he sees everyone from the spiritual platform. Thus the only alternative left to Lord &#346;iva was to leave in order to stop his follower, Nand&#299;&#347;vara, as well as Bhrigu Muni, from cursing and countercursing in that way.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
