Shaking and very much afflicted, she looked at her uncommon husband, Lord &#346;iva, as if she were going to blast him with her vision.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The word apratip&#363;rusham, used in this verse, means "one who has no equal." Lord &#346;iva has no equal in the material world in regard to equality towards everyone. His wife, Sat&#299;, knew that her husband was equal towards everyone, so why in this case was he so unkind to his wife that he did not allow her to go to her father's house? This distressed her more than she could tolerate, and she looked at her husband as if she were ready to blast him with her vision. In other words, since Lord &#346;iva is the &#257;tm&#257; (&#347;iva also means &#257;tm&#257;), it is indicated here that Sat&#299; was prepared to commit suicide. Another meaning of the word apratip&#363;rusha is "the personality who has no rival." Since Lord &#346;iva could not be persuaded to give her permission, Sat&#299; took shelter of a woman's last weapon, weeping, which forces a husband to agree to the proposal of his wife.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
