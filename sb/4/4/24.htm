Dressed in saffron garments, she sanctified herself with water and closed her eyes to absorb herself in the process of mystic yoga.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>It is said that when a man desires to quit his body he dresses in saffron garments. Therefore it appears that Sat&#299; changed her dress, indicating that she was going to quit the body given her by Daksha. Daksha was Sat&#299;'s father, so instead of killing Daksha she decided that it would be better to destroy the part of his body which was hers. Thus she decided to give up the body of Daksha by the yogic process. Sat&#299; was the wife of Lord &#346;iva, who is known as Yoge&#347;vara, the best among all yog&#299;s, because he knows all the mystic processes of yoga, so it appeared that Sat&#299; also knew them. Either she learned yoga from her husband or she was enlightened because she was the daughter of such a great king as Daksha. The perfection of yoga is that one can give up one's body or release oneself from the embodiment of material elements according to one's desire. Yog&#299;s who have attained perfection are not subject to death by natural laws; such perfect yog&#299;s can leave the body whenever they desire. Generally the yog&#299; first of all becomes mature in controlling the air passing within the body, thus bringing the soul to the top of the brain. Then when the body bursts into flames, the yog&#299; can go anywhere he likes. This yoga system recognizes the soul, and thus it is distinct from the so-called yoga process for controlling the cells of the body, which has been discovered in the modern age. The real yoga process accepts the transmigration of the soul from one planet to another or one body to another; and it appears from this incident that Sat&#299; wanted to transfer her soul to another body or sphere.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
