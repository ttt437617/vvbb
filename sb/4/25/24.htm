The symptoms of r&#257;ga and dvesha (attachment and envy) are described in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/3/34.htm">3.34</A>):</P><P>indriyasyendriyasy&#257;rthe</P><P CLASS=n>r&#257;ga-dveshau vyavasthitau</P><P CLASS=n>tayor na va&#347;am &#257;gacchet</P><P CLASS=n>tau hy asya paripanthinau</P><P>"Attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, but one should not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization."</P><P>These representatives of attachment and envy are very much unfavorable for advancement in spiritual life. One should not be attracted by the breasts of young women. The great saint &#346;a&#324;kar&#257;c&#257;rya has described the breasts of women, especially young women, as nothing but a combination of muscles and blood, so one should not be attracted by the illusory energy of raised breasts with nipples. They are agents of m&#257;y&#257; meant to victimize the opposite sex. Because the breasts are equally attractive, they are described as sama-vrittau. The sex impulse remains in an old man's heart also, even up to the point of death. To be rid of such agitation, one must be very much advanced in spiritual consciousness, like Y&#257;mun&#257;c&#257;rya, who said:</P><P>yad-avadhi mama cetah krishna-p&#257;d&#257;ravinde</P><P CLASS=n>nava-nava-rasa-dh&#257;many udyatam rantum &#257;s&#299;t</P><P CLASS=n>tad-avadhi bata n&#257;r&#299;-sa&#324;game smaryam&#257;ne</P><P CLASS=n>bhavati mukha-vik&#257;rah sushthu nishth&#299;vanam ca</P><P>"Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krishna, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste." When one is spiritually advanced he can no longer be attracted by the lumps of flesh and blood which are the breasts of young women. The word nirantarau is significant because although the breasts are situated in different locations, the action is the same. We should not make any distinction between attachment and envy. As described in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/3/37.htm">3.37</A>), they are both products of rajo-guna (k&#257;ma esha krodha esha rajo-guna-samudbhavah).</P><P>The word nig&#363;hant&#299;m ("trying to cover") indicates that even if one is tainted by k&#257;ma, lobha, krodha, etc., they can be transfigured by Krishna consciousness. In other words, one can utilize k&#257;ma (lust) for serving Krishna. Being impelled by lust, an ordinary worker will work hard day and night; similarly a devotee can work hard day and night to satisfy Krishna. Just as karm&#299;s are working hard to satisfy k&#257;ma-krodha, a devotee should work in the same way to satisfy Krishna. Similarly, krodha (anger) can also be used in the service of Krishna when it is applied to the nondevotee demons. Hanum&#257;nj&#299; applied his anger in this way. He was a great devotee of Lord R&#257;macandra, and he utilized his anger to set fire to the kingdom of R&#257;vana, a nondevotee demon. Thus k&#257;ma (lust) can be utilized to satisfy Krishna, and krodha (anger) can be utilized to punish the demons. When both are used for Krishna's service, they lose their material significance and become spiritually important.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
