If they were aware of it, why did they not explain it to me?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Actually the so-called teachers or leaders of material society do not really know the goal of life. They are described in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; as m&#257;yay&#257;pahrita jñ&#257;n&#257;h. They appear to be very learned scholars, but actually the influence of the illusory energy has taken away their knowledge. Real knowledge means searching out Krishna. Vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedyah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">Bg. 15.15</A>]. All Vedic knowledge is meant for searching out Krishna because Krishna is the origin of everything. Janm&#257;dy asya yatah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/1/1.htm">SB 1.1.1</A>]. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/2.htm">10.2</A>) Krishna says, aham &#257;dir hi dev&#257;n&#257;m: "I am the source of the demigods." Thus Krishna is the origin and beginning of all demigods, including Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva and all others. The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies are concerned with satisfying different demigods, but unless one is very advanced, he cannot understand that the original personality is &#346;r&#299; Krishna. Govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi **. After hearing the instructions of N&#257;rada, King Barhishm&#257;n came to his senses. The real goal of life is to attain devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The King therefore decided to reject the so-called priestly orders that simply engage their followers in the ritualistic ceremonies without giving effective instructions about the goal of life. At the present moment the churches, temples and mosques all over the world are not attracting people because foolish priests cannot elevate their followers to the platform of knowledge. Not being aware of the real goal of life, they simply keep their congregations in ignorance. Consequently, those who are well educated have become uninterested in the ritualistic ceremonies. At the same time, they are not benefited with real knowledge. This Krishna consciousness movement is therefore very important for the enlightenment of all classes. Following in the footsteps of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Barhishm&#257;n, everyone should take advantage of this Krishna consciousness movement and abandon the stereotyped ritualistic ceremonies that go under the garb of so many religions. The Gosv&#257;m&#299;s from the very beginning differed from the priestly class that was engaged in ritualistic ceremonies. Indeed, &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; compiled his Hari-bhakti-vil&#257;sa for the guidance of the Vaishnavas. The Vaishnavas, not caring for the lifeless activities of the priestly classes, take to full Krishna consciousness and become perfect in this very life. That is described in the previous verse as paramahamsa-&#347;aranam, taking shelter of the paramahamsa, the liberated soul, and becoming successful in this life.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="57.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
