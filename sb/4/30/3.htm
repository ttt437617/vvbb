By chanting and repeating the mantras given by Lord &#346;iva, they were able to satisfy Lord Vishnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>One can offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly, but if one repeats the prayers offered by great devotees like Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257;, or if one follows in the footsteps of great personalities, one can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. For instance, we sometimes chant this mantra of Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/29.htm">5.29</A>):</P><P>cint&#257;mani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vriksha-</P><P CLASS=n>laksh&#257;vriteshu surabh&#299;r abhip&#257;layantam</P><P CLASS=n>lakshm&#299;-sahasra-&#347;ata-sambhrama-sevyam&#257;nam</P><P CLASS=n>govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi</P><P>"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, yielding all desires, in abodes built with spiritual gems and surrounded by millions of purpose trees. He is always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of lakshm&#299;s, or gop&#299;s." Because this prayer was offered by Lord Brahm&#257;, we follow him by reciting this prayer. That is the easiest way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The pure devotee never attempts to reach the Supreme Lord directly. The most important way to worship the Lord is to go through the disciplic succession of devotees. The prayers offered by Lord &#346;iva to the Supreme Personality of Godhead were thus repeated by the Pracet&#257;s, who were thus very successful in pleasing the Supreme Lord.</P><P>Here the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as purañjana. According to Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, the living entity is called purañjana because he has become an inhabitant of this material world, and under the influence of the three modes of material nature, he is forced to live within it. The Supreme Personality of Godhead creates this material world (pura), and He also enters within it. And&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;nu-cay&#257;ntara-stham. The Lord enters within the heart of the living entity and within the atom; therefore both the living entity and the Lord are called purañjana. One purañjana, the living entity, is subordinate to the supreme purañjana; therefore the duty of the subordinate purañjana is to satisfy the supreme purañjana. That is devotional service. Lord Rudra, or Lord &#346;iva, is the original &#257;c&#257;rya of the Vaishnava samprad&#257;ya called the Rudra-samprad&#257;ya. Rudra-g&#299;tena indicates that under the disciplic succession of Lord Rudra, the Pracet&#257;s achieved spiritual success.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
