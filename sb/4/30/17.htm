Indeed, you can enjoy all of them without hindrance and with full strength for one million celestial years.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The duration of life prescribed for the Pracet&#257;s by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is calculated by the time measurements of higher planetary systems. Our six earth months are said to equal twelve hours in the higher planetary systems. Thirty days equal one month, and twelve months equal one year. In this way, for one million years according to the calculations of the higher planetary system the Pracet&#257;s were allowed to enjoy all kinds of material facilities. Although this life-span was so long, the Pracet&#257;s were given full bodily strength by the grace of the Lord. In the material world, if one wants to live for many years, he must endure the difficulties of old age, invalidity and many other miserable conditions. The Pracet&#257;s, however, were given full bodily strength to enjoy material facilities. This special facility was given to the Pracet&#257;s so that they could continue rendering full devotional service. This will be explained in the following verse.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
