Therefore you may imperceptibly attack people in general. Helped by my soldiers, you can kill them without opposition.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The word karma-vinirmitam means "manufactured by fruitive activities." This entire material world, especially in these days, is the result of fruitive activities. Everyone is fully engaged in decorating the world with highways, motorcars, electricity, skyscrapers, industries, businesses, etc. All this appears very nice for those who are simply engaged in sense gratification and who are ignorant of spiritual identity. As described in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../5/5/4.htm">5.5.4</A>):</P><P>n&#363;nam pramattah kurute vikarma</P><P CLASS=n>yad indriya-pr&#299;taya &#257;prinoti</P><P CLASS=n>na s&#257;dhu manye yata &#257;tmano 'yam</P><P CLASS=n>asann api kle&#347;ada &#257;sa dehah</P><P>Those without knowledge of the spirit soul are mad after materialistic activities, and they perform all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. According to Rishabhadeva, such activities are inauspicious because they force one to accept an abominable body in the next life. Everyone can experience that although we try to keep the body in a comfortable position, it is always giving pain and is subjected to the threefold miseries. Otherwise, why are there so many hospitals, welfare boards and insurance establishments? Actually, in this world there is no happiness. People are simply engaged trying to counteract unhappiness. Foolish people accept unhappiness as happiness; therefore the King of the Yavanas decided to attack such foolish people imperceptibly by old age, disease, and ultimately death. Of course, after death there must be birth; therefore Yavana-r&#257;ja thought it wise to kill all the karm&#299;s through the agency of K&#257;lakany&#257; and thus try to make them aware that materialistic advancement is not actually advancement. Every living entity is a spiritual being, and consequently without spiritual advancement the human form of life is ruined.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
