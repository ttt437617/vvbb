Thereafter he disappeared from Dhruva's presence, and Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja returned to his capital city.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Kuvera, who is known as the son of Idavid&#257;, was very pleased with Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja because he did not ask him for anything materially enjoyable. Kuvera is one of the demigods, so one may put forward the argument, "Why did Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja take a benediction from a demigod?" The answer is that for a Vaishnava there is no objection to taking a benediction from a demigod if it is favorable for advancing Krishna consciousness. The gop&#299;s, for example, worshiped K&#257;ty&#257;yan&#299;, a demigoddess, but the only benediction they wanted from the goddess was to have Krishna as their husband. A Vaishnava is not interested in asking any benediction from the demigods, nor is he interested in asking benedictions from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said in the Bh&#257;gavatam that liberation can be offered by the Supreme Person, but even if a pure devotee is offered liberation by the Supreme Lord, he refuses to accept it. Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not ask Kuvera for transference to the spiritual world, which is called liberation; he simply asked that wherever he would remain &#8212; whether in the spiritual or material world &#8212; he would always remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A Vaishnava is always respectful to everyone. So when Kuvera offered him a benediction, he did not refuse it. But he wanted something which would be favorable to his advancement in Krishna consciousness.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
