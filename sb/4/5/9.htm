He was so cruel that he would not save her youngest daughter, Sat&#299;, from the act of committing suicide in the presence of her sisters. Sat&#299;'s mother could understand how much Sat&#299; had been pained by the insult of her father. Sat&#299; had been present along with the other daughters, and Daksha had purposely received all of them but her because she happened to be the wife of Lord &#346;iva. This consideration convinced the wife of Daksha of the danger which was now ahead, and thus she knew that Daksha must be prepared to die for his heinous act.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
