By his grace we have finished three cantos already, and we are just trying to begin the Fourth Canto. By his divine grace let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Caitanya, who began this Krishna consciousness movement of Bh&#257;gavata-dharma five hundred years ago, and through His grace let us offer our obeisances to the six Gosv&#257;m&#299;s, and then let us offer our obeisances to R&#257;dh&#257; and Krishna, the spiritual couple who enjoy eternally in Vrind&#257;vana with Their cowherd boys and damsels in Vrajabh&#363;mi. Let us also offer our respectful obeisances to all the devotees and eternal servitors of the Supreme Lord.</P><P>In this Fourth Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam there are thirty-one chapters, and all these chapters describe the secondary creation by Brahm&#257; and the Manus. The Supreme Lord Himself does the real creation by agitating His material energy, and then, by His order, Brahma, the first living creature in the universe, attempts to create the different planetary systems and their inhabitants, expanding the population through his progeny, like Manu and other progenitors of living entities, who work perpetually under the order of the Supreme Lord. ln the First Chapter of this Fourth Canto there are descriptions of the three daughters of Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu and their descendants. The next six chapters describe the sacrifice performed by King Daksha and how it was spoiled. Thereafter the activities of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dhruva are described in five chapters. Then, in eleven chapters, the activities of King Prithu are described, and the next eight chapters are devoted to the activities of the Pracet&#257; kings.</P><P>As described in the first verse of this chapter, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu had three daughters, named &#256;k&#363;ti, Devah&#363;ti and Pras&#363;ti. Of these three daughters, one daughter, Devah&#363;ti, has already been described, along with her husband, Kardama Muni, and her son, Kapila Muni. In this chapter the descendants of the first daughter, &#256;k&#363;ti, will specifically be described. Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu was the son of Brahm&#257;. Brahm&#257; had many other sons, but Manu's name is specifically mentioned first because he was a great devotee of the Lord. In this verse there is also the word ca, indicating that besides the three daughters mentioned, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu also had two sons.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../../3/33/37.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
