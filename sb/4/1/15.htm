Soma was a partial representation of Lord Brahm&#257;, Datt&#257;treya was a partial representation of Lord Vishnu, and Durv&#257;s&#257; was a partial representation of Lord &#346;iva.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In this verse we find the words &#257;tma-&#299;&#347;a-brahma-sambhav&#257;n. &#256;tma means the Supersoul, or Vishnu, &#299;&#347;a means Lord &#346;iva, and brahma means the four-headed Lord Brahm&#257;. The three sons born of Anas&#363;y&#257; &#8212; Datt&#257;treya, Durv&#257;s&#257; and Soma &#8212; were born as partial representations of these three demigods. &#256;tma is not in the category of the demigods or living entities because He is Vishnu; therefore He is described as vibhinn&#257;m&#347;a-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m. The Supersoul, Vishnu, is the seed-giving father of all living entities, including Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva. Another meaning of the word &#257;tma may be accepted in this way: the principle who is the Supersoul in every &#257;tma, or, one may say, the soul of everyone, became manifested as Datt&#257;treya, because the word am&#347;a, part and parcel, is used here.</P><P>In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; the individual souls are also described as parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or Supersoul, so why not accept that Datt&#257;treya was one of those parts? Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257; are also described here as parts, so why not accept all of them as ordinary individual souls? The answer is that the manifestations of Vishnu and those of the ordinary living entities are certainly all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and no one is equal to Him, but among the parts and parcels there are different categories. In the Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;na it is nicely explained that some of the parts are sv&#257;m&#347;a and some are vibhinn&#257;m&#347;a. Vibhinn&#257;m&#347;a parts are called j&#299;vas, and sv&#257;m&#347;a parts are in the Vishnu category. In the j&#299;va category, the vibhinn&#257;m&#347;a parts and parcels, there are also gradations. That is explained in the Vishnu Pur&#257;na, where it is clearly stated that the individual parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord are subject to being covered by the external energy, called illusion, or m&#257;y&#257;. Such individual parts and parcels, who can travel to any part of the Lord's creation, are called sarva-gata and are suffering the pangs of material existence. They are proportionately freed from the coverings of ignorance under material existence according to different levels of work and under different influences of the modes of material nature. For example, the sufferings of j&#299;vas situated in the mode of goodness are less than those of j&#299;vas situated in the mode of ignorance. Pure Krishna consciousness, however, is the birthright of all living entities because every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The consciousness of the Lord is also in the part and parcel, and according to the proportion to which that consciousness is cleared of material dirt, the living entities are differently situated. ln the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra, the living entities of different gradations are compared to candles or lamps with different candle power. For example, some electric bulbs have the power of one thousand candles, some have the power of five hundred candles, some the power of one hundred candles, some fifty candles, etc., but all electric bulbs have light. Light is present in every bulb, but the gradations of light are different. Similarly, there are gradations of Brahman. The Vishnu sv&#257;m&#347;a expansions of the Supreme Lord in different Vishnu forms are like lamps, Lord &#346;iva is also like a lamp, and the supreme candle power, or the one-hundred-percent light, is Krishna. The vishnu-tattva has ninety-four percent, the &#347;iva-tattva has eighty-four percent, Lord Brahm&#257; has seventy-eight percent, and the living entities are also like Brahm&#257;, but in the conditioned state their power is still more dim. There are gradations of Brahman, and no one can deny this fact. Therefore the words &#257;tme&#347;a-brahma-sambhav&#257;n indicate that Datt&#257;treya was directly part and parcel of Vishnu, whereas Durv&#257;s&#257; and Soma were parts and parcels of Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257;.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
