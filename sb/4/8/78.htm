Brahman refers to one who not only is the greatest, but has the potency to expand to an unlimited extent. How was it possible for Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to capture Brahman within his heart? This question has been very nicely answered by J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;. He says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of Brahman, for since He comprises everything material and spiritual, there cannot be anything greater than He. In the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; also the Supreme Godhead says, "I am the resting place of Brahman." Many persons, especially the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers, consider Brahman the biggest, all-expanding substance, but according to this verse and other Vedic literatures, such as Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, the resting place of Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the resting place of the sunshine is the sun globe. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, therefore, says that since the transcendental form of the Lord is the seed of all greatness, He is the Supreme Brahman. Since the Supreme Brahman was situated in the heart of Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, he became heavier than the heaviest, and therefore everything trembled in all three worlds and in the spiritual world.</P><P>The mahat-tattva, or the sum total of the material creation, is to be understood to be the ultimate end of all universes, including all the living entities therein. Brahman is the resort of the mahat-tattva, which includes all material and spiritual entities. It is described in this connection that the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, is the master of both pradh&#257;na and purusha. Pradh&#257;na means subtle matter, such as ether. purusha means the spiritual spark living entities who are entangled in that subtle material existence. These may also be described as par&#257; prakriti and apar&#257; prakriti, as stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. Krishna, being the controller of both the prakritis, is thus the master of pradh&#257;na and purusha. In the Vedic hymns also the Supreme Brahman is described as antah-pravishtah &#347;&#257;st&#257;. This indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is controlling everything and entering into everything. The Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/35.htm">5.35</A>) further confirms this. And&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;nu-cay&#257;ntara-stham: He has entered not only the universes, but even the atom. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/42.htm">10.42</A>) Krishna also says, vishtabhy&#257;ham idam kritsnam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls everything by entering into everything. By associating constantly with the Supreme Personality in his heart, Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja naturally became equal to the greatest, Brahman, by His association, and thus became the heaviest, and the entire universe trembled. ln conclusion, a person who always concentrates on the transcendental form of Krishna within his heart can very easily strike the whole world with wonder at his activities. This is the perfection of yoga performance, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/6/47.htm">6.47</A>). Yogin&#257;m api sarvesh&#257;m: of all yog&#299;s, the bhakti-yog&#299;, who thinks of Krishna always within his heart and engages in His loving transcendental service, is the topmost. Ordinary yog&#299;s can exhibit wonderful material activities, known as ashta-siddhi, eight kinds of yogic perfection, but a pure devotee of the Lord can surpass these perfections by performing activities which can make the whole universe tremble.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="77.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="79.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
