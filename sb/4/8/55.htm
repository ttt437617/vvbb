In the Western countries, while engaged in propagating the Krishna consciousness movement, we were brought great unhappiness because we could not find tulas&#299; leaves. We are very much obliged, therefore, to our disciple &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Govinda d&#257;s&#299; because she has taken much care to grow tulas&#299; plants from seeds, and she has been successful by the grace of Krishna. Now tulas&#299; plants are growing in almost every center of our movement.</P><P>Tulas&#299; leaves are very important in the method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the word salilaih means "by the water." Of course, Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was worshiping on the bank of the Yamun&#257;. The Yamun&#257; and the Ganges are sacred, and sometimes devotees in India insist that the Deity must be worshiped with water of the Ganges or Yamun&#257;. But here we understand de&#347;a-k&#257;la to mean "according to time and country." In the Western countries there is no River Yamun&#257; or Ganges &#8212; water from such sacred rivers is not available. Does this mean that the arc&#257; worship should for that reason be stopped? No. Salilaih refers to any water &#8212; whatever is available &#8212; but it must be very clear and collected purely. That water can be used. The other paraphernalia, such as flower garlands, fruits and vegetables, should be collected according to the country and according to their availability. Tulas&#299; leaves are very important for satisfying the Lord, so as far as possible an arrangement should be made for growing tulas&#299; leaves. Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was advised to worship the Lord with the fruits and flowers available in the forest. In the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; Krishna frankly says that He accepts vegetables, fruits, flowers, etc. One should not offer Lord V&#257;sudeva anything other than what is prescribed herein by the great authority N&#257;rada Muni. One cannot offer to the Deity according to one's whims; since these fruits and vegetables are available anywhere in the universe, we should observe this small point very attentively.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="54.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="56.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
