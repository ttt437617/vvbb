You are like the sun, which rotates in the universe for the benefit of all living beings.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, although a young child, expressed his hope that he might be offered the benediction of a kingdom which would exceed in opulence those of his father and grandfather. He also expressed his gladness that he had met such an exalted person as N&#257;rada, whose only concern was to illuminate the world, like the sun, which rotates all over the universe only for the purpose of benefiting the inhabitants of all planets. N&#257;rada Muni travels all over the universe for the sole purpose of performing the best welfare activity for the entire universe by teaching everyone how to become a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja felt fully assured that N&#257;rada Muni could fulfill his desire, even though the desire was very extraordinary.</P><P>The example of the sun is very significant. The sun is so kind that he distributes his sunshine everywhere, without consideration. Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja requested N&#257;rada Muni to be merciful to him. He pointed out that N&#257;rada travels all over the universe just for the purpose of doing good to all conditioned souls. He requested that N&#257;rada Muni show his mercy by awarding him the benefit of his particular desire. Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was strongly determined to fulfill his desire, and it was for that purpose that he had left his home and palace.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
