You should go to the bank of the Yamun&#257;, where there is a virtuous forest named Madhuvana, and there be purified. Just by going there, one draws nearer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who always lives there.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Both N&#257;rada Muni and Sun&#299;ti, the mother of Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, advised Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now, N&#257;rada Muni is especially giving him directions how this worship of the Supreme Person can very quickly fructify. He recommends that Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja go to the bank of the Yamun&#257;, where there is a forest of the name Madhuvana, and begin his meditation and worship there.</P><P>Places of pilgrimage yield a special advantage for a devotee in quickly advancing his spiritual life. Lord Krishna lives everywhere, but still it is very easy to approach Him in holy places of pilgrimage because these places are inhabited by great sages. Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna says that He lives wherever His devotees are chanting the glories of His transcendental activities. There are many places of pilgrimage in India, and especially prominent are Badar&#299;-n&#257;r&#257;yana, Dv&#257;rak&#257;, R&#257;me&#347;vara and Jagann&#257;tha pur&#299;. These sacred places are called the four dh&#257;mas. Dh&#257;ma refers to a place where one can immediately contact the Supreme Lord. To go to Badar&#299;-n&#257;r&#257;yana one has to pass through Hardwar on the path to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, there are other holy places of pilgrimage, such as Pray&#257;ga (Allahabad) and Mathur&#257;, and the topmost of them all is Vrind&#257;vana. Unless one is very advanced in spiritual life, it is recommended that he live in such holy places and execute devotional service there. But an advanced devotee like N&#257;rada Muni who is engaged in preaching work can serve the Supreme Lord anywhere. Sometimes he even goes to the hellish planets. Hellish conditions do not affect N&#257;rada Muni because he is engaged in greatly responsible activities in devotional service. According to the statement of N&#257;rada Muni, Madhuvana, which is still existing in the Vrind&#257;vana area, in the district of Mathur&#257;, is a most sacred place. Many saintly persons still live there and engage in the devotional service of the Lord.</P><P>There are twelve forests in the area of Vrind&#257;vana, and Madhuvana is one of them. Pilgrims from all parts of India assemble together and visit all twelve of these forests. There are five forests on the eastern bank of the Yamun&#257;: Bhadravana, Bilvavana, Lauhavana, Bh&#257;nd&#299;ravana and Mah&#257;vana. On the western side of the bank there are seven: Madhuvana, T&#257;lavana, Kumudavana, Bahul&#257;vana, K&#257;myavana, Khadiravana and Vrind&#257;vana. ln those twelve forests there are different gh&#257;tas, or bathing places. They are listed as follows: (1) Avimukta, (2) Adhir&#363;dha, (3) Guhya-t&#299;rtha, (4) Pray&#257;ga-t&#299;rtha, (5) Kanakhala, (6) Tinduka-t&#299;rtha, (7) S&#363;rya-t&#299;rtha, (8) Vatasv&#257;m&#299;, (9) Dhruva-gh&#257;ta (Dhruva-gh&#257;ta, where there are many nice trees of fruits and flowers, is famous because Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja meditated and underwent severe penances and austerities there in an elevated spot), (10) Rishi-t&#299;rtha, (11) Moksha-t&#299;rtha, (12) Budha-t&#299;rtha, (13) Gokarna, (14) Krishnaga&#324;g&#257;, (15) Vaikuntha, (16) Asi-kunda, (17) Catuh-s&#257;mudrika-k&#363;pa, (18) Akr&#363;ra-t&#299;rtha (when Krishna and Balar&#257;ma were going to Mathur&#257; in the chariot driven by Akr&#363;ra, all of them took baths in this gh&#257;ta), (19) Y&#257;jñika-vipra-sth&#257;na, (20) Kubj&#257;-k&#363;pa, (21) Ra&#324;ga-sthala, (22) Mañcha-sthala, (23) Mallayuddha-sth&#257;na, and (24) Da&#347;&#257;&#347;vamedha.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
