All of you should take this important stotra within your minds and promise to keep it in order to become great sages. By acting silently like a great sage and by giving attention and reverence, you should practice this method.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In the hatha-yoga system one has to practice bodily exercises, dhy&#257;na, dh&#257;ran&#257;, &#257;sana, meditation, etc. One also has to sit in one place in a particular posture and concentrate his gaze on the tip of the nose. There are so many rules and regulations for the hatha-yoga system that it is practically impossible to perform it in this age. The alternative system of bhakti-yoga is very easy not only in this age but in others as well, for this yoga system was advocated long ago by Lord &#346;iva when he advised the princes, the sons of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhishat. The bhakti-yoga system is not newly introduced, for even five thousand years ago Lord Krishna recommended this bhakti-yoga as the topmost yoga. As Krishna tells Arjuna in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/6/47.htm">6.47</A>):</P><P>yogin&#257;m api sarvesh&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>mad-gaten&#257;ntar&#257;tman&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;raddh&#257;v&#257;n bhajate yo m&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>sa me yuktatamo matah</P><P>"Of all yog&#299;s, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all."</P><P>The topmost yog&#299; is he who constantly thinks of Krishna within himself and chants the glories of the Lord. In other words, this system of bhakti-yoga has been existing from time immemorial and is now continuing in this Krishna consciousness movement.</P><P>The word muni-vrat&#257;h is significant in this regard because those who are interested in advancing in spiritual life must be silent. Silence means talking only of krishna-kath&#257;. This is the silence of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha:</P><P>sa vai manah krishna-pad&#257;ravindayor</P><P CLASS=n>vac&#257;msi vaikuntha-gun&#257;nuvarnane</P><P>"King Ambar&#299;sha always fixed his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord and talked of Him only." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/9/4/19.htm">9.4.19</A>) We should also take this opportunity in life to become as good as a great saint simply by not talking unnecessarily with unwanted persons. We should either talk of Krishna or chant Hare Krishna undeviatingly. This is called muni-vrata. The intelligence must be very sharp (sam&#257;hita-dhiyah) and should always be acting in Krishna consciousness. The words etad abhyasat&#257;drit&#257;h indicate that if one takes these instructions from a spiritual master with great reverence (&#257;drita) and practices them accordingly, he will find this bhakti-yoga process to be very, very easy.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="70.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="72.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
