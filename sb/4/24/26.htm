Being very much pleased with the princes, he began to speak as follows.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu, or Krishna, is known as bhakta-vatsala, and herein we find Lord &#346;iva described as dharma-vatsala. Of course, the word dharma-vatsala refers to a person who lives according to religious principles. That is understood. Nonetheless, these two words have additional significance. Sometimes Lord &#346;iva has to deal with persons who are in the modes of passion and ignorance. Such persons are not always very much religious and pious in their activities, but since they worship Lord &#346;iva for some material profit, they sometimes obey the religious principles. As soon as Lord &#346;iva sees that his devotees are following religious principles, he blesses them. The Pracet&#257;s, sons of Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi, were naturally very pious and gentle, and consequently Lord &#346;iva was immediately pleased with them. Lord &#346;iva could understand that the princes were sons of Vaishnavas, and as such Lord &#346;iva offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead as follows.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="24-25.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
