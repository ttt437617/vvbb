You are the master of all the worlds' metaphysical philosophy, for You are the supreme cause of all causes, Lord Krishna. You are the greatest of all religious principles, the supreme mind, and You have a brain which is never checked by any condition. Therefore I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto You.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The words krishn&#257;ya akuntha-medhase are significant in this verse. Modern scientists have stopped their brainwork by discovering the theory of uncertainty, but factually for a living being there cannot be any brain activity which is not checked by time and space limitations. A living entity is called anu, an atomic particle of the supreme soul, and therefore his brain is also atomic. It cannot accommodate unlimited knowledge. This does not mean, however, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, has a limited brain. What Krishna says and does is not limited by time and space. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/26.htm">7.26</A>) the Lord says:</P><P>ved&#257;ham samat&#299;t&#257;ni</P><P CLASS=n>vartam&#257;n&#257;ni c&#257;rjuna</P><P CLASS=n>bhavishy&#257;ni ca bh&#363;t&#257;ni</P><P CLASS=n>m&#257;m tu veda na ka&#347;cana</P><P>"O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows."</P><P>Krishna knows everything, but one cannot know Krishna without being favored by Him. Thus for Krishna and His representative there is no question of a theory of uncertainty. What Krishna says is all perfect and certain and is applicable to the past, present and future. Nor is there any uncertainty for one who knows exactly what Krishna says. The Krishna consciousness movement is based on Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; as it is, as spoken by Lord Krishna, and for those who are engaged in this movement, there is no question of uncertainty.</P><P>Lord Krishna is also addressed herein as &#257;&#347;ish&#257;m &#299;&#347;a. The great saintly personalities, sages and demigods are able to offer benedictions to ordinary living entities, but they in turn are benedicted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without being benedicted by Krishna, one cannot offer benediction to anyone else. The word manave, meaning "unto the supreme Manu," is also significant. The supreme Manu in Vedic literature is Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, who is an incarnation of Krishna. All the Manus are empowered incarnations of Krishna (manvantara-avat&#257;ra). There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahm&#257;, 420 in one month, all the Manus are directors of human society, ultimately Krishna is the supreme director of human society. In another sense, the word manave indicates the perfection of all kinds of mantras. The mantra delivers the conditioned soul from his bondage; so simply by chanting the mantra Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare, one can gain deliverance from any condition.</P><P>K&#257;ran&#257;tmane: everything has a cause. The theory of chance is repudiated in this verse. Because everything has its cause, there is no question of chance. Because so-called philosophers and scientists are unable to find the real cause, they foolishly say that everything happens by chance. In Brahma-samhit&#257; Krishna is described as the cause of all causes; therefore He is addressed herein as k&#257;ran&#257;tmane. His very personality is the original cause of everything, the root of everything and the seed of everything. As described in the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/sutra1/1/2">1.1.2</A>), janm&#257;dy asya yatah: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/1/1.htm">SB 1.1.1</A>] the Absolute Truth is the supreme cause of all emanations.</P><P>The word s&#257;&#324;khya-yoge&#347;var&#257;ya is also significant herein, for Krishna is described in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; as Yoge&#347;vara, the master of all mystic powers. Without possessing inconceivable mystic powers, one cannot be accepted as God. In this age of Kali, those who have a little fragmental portion of mystic power claim to be God, but such pseudo Gods can only be accepted as fools, for only Krishna is the Supreme Person who possesses all mystic and yogic perfections. The s&#257;&#324;khya-yoga system popular at the present moment was propounded by the atheist Kapila, but the original s&#257;&#324;khya-yoga system was propounded by an incarnation of Krishna also named Kapila, the son of Devah&#363;ti. Similarly, Datt&#257;treya, another incarnation of Krishna, also explained the s&#257;&#324;khya-yoga system. Thus Krishna is the origin of all s&#257;&#324;khya-yoga systems and mystic yoga powers.</P><P>The words purush&#257;ya pur&#257;n&#257;ya are also worthy of special attention. In Brahma-samhit&#257;, Krishna is accepted as the &#257;di-purusha, the original person, or the original enjoyer. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, Lord Krishna is also accepted as pur&#257;na-purusha, the oldest person. Although He is the oldest of all personalities, He is also the youngest of all, or nava-yauvana. Another significant word is dharm&#257;ya. Since Krishna is the original propounder of all kinds of religious principles, it is said: dharmam tu s&#257;ksh&#257;d bhagavat-pran&#299;tam (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/6/3/19.htm">6.3.19</A>). No one can introduce a new type of religion, for religion is already there, having been established by Lord Krishna. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; Krishna informs us of the original dharma and asks us to give up all kinds of religious principles. The real dharma is surrender unto Him. In the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, it is also said:</P><P>ye ca veda-vido vipr&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>ye c&#257;dhy&#257;tma-vido jan&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>te vadanti mah&#257;tm&#257;nam</P><P CLASS=n>krishnam dharmam san&#257;tanam</P><P>The purport is that one who has studied the Vedas perfectly, who is a perfect vipra, or knower of the Vedas, who knows what spiritual life actually is, speaks about Krishna, the Supreme Person, as one's san&#257;tana-dharma. Lord &#346;iva therefore teaches us the principles of san&#257;tana-dharma.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
