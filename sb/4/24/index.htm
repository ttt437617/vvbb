His wife's name was &#346;ikhandin&#299;, and by her he begot three good sons.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 4.24.4</B></A>: The three sons of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Antardh&#257;na were named P&#257;vaka, Pavam&#257;na and &#346;uci. Formerly these three personalities were the demigods of fire, but due to the curse of the great sage Vasishtha, they became the sons of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Antardh&#257;na. As such, they were as powerful as the fire-gods, and they attained the destination of mystic yoga power, being again situated as the demigods of fire.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 4.24.5</B></A>: Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Antardh&#257;na had another wife, named Nabhasvat&#299;, and by her he was happy to beget another son, named Havirdh&#257;na. Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Antardh&#257;na was very liberal, he did not kill Indra while the demigod was stealing his father's horse at the sacrifice.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 4.24.6</B></A>: Whenever Antardh&#257;na, the supreme royal power, had to exact taxes, punish his citizens or fine them severely, he was not willing to do so. Consequently he retired from the execution of such duties and engaged himself in the performance of different sacrifices.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 4.24.7</B></A>: Although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Antardh&#257;na was engaged in performing sacrifices, because he was a self-realized soul he very intelligently rendered devotional service to the Lord, who eradicates all the fears of His devotees. By thus worshiping the Supreme Lord, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Antardh&#257;na, rapt in ecstasy, attained His planet very easily.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 4.24.8</B></A>: Havirdh&#257;na, the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Antardh&#257;na, had a wife named Havirdh&#257;n&#299;, who gave birth to six sons, named Barhishat, Gaya, &#346;ukla, Krishna, Satya and Jitavrata.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 4.24.9</B></A>: The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, Havirdh&#257;na's very powerful son named Barhishat was very expert in performing various kinds of fruitive sacrifices, and he was also expert in the practice of mystic yoga. By his great qualifications, he became known as Praj&#257;pati.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 4.24.10</B></A>: Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Barhishat executed many sacrifices all over the world. He scattered ku&#347;a grasses and kept the tops of the grasses pointed eastward.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 4.24.11</B></A>: Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Barhishat &#8212; henceforward known as Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi &#8212; was ordered by the supreme demigod Lord Brahm&#257; to marry the daughter of the ocean named &#346;atadruti. Her bodily features were completely beautiful, and she was very young. She was decorated with the proper garments, and when she came into the marriage arena and began circumambulating it, the fire-god Agni became so attracted to her that he desired her company, exactly as he had formerly desired to enjoy &#346;uk&#299;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 4.24.12</B></A>: While &#346;atadruti was thus being married, the demons, the denizens of Gandharvaloka, the great sages, and the denizens of Siddhaloka, the earthly planets and N&#257;galoka, although highly exalted, were all captivated by the tinkling of her ankle bells.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 4.24.13</B></A>: King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi begot ten children in the womb of &#346;atadruti. All of them were equally endowed with religiosity, and all of them were known as the Pracet&#257;s.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 4.24.14</B></A>: When all these Pracet&#257;s were ordered by their father to marry and beget children, they all entered the ocean and practiced austerities and penances for ten thousand years. Thus they worshiped the master of all austerity, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 4.24.15</B></A>: When all the sons of Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi left home to execute austerities, they met Lord &#346;iva, who, out of great mercy, instructed them about the Absolute Truth. All the sons of Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi meditated upon the instructions, chanting and worshiping them with great care and attention.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 4.24.16</B></A>: Vidura asked Maitreya: My dear br&#257;hmana, why did the Pracet&#257;s meet Lord &#346;iva on the way? Please tell me how the meeting happened, how Lord &#346;iva became very pleased with them and how he instructed them. Certainly such talks are important, and I wish that you please be merciful upon me and describe them.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 4.24.17</B></A>: The great sage Vidura continued: O best of the br&#257;hmanas, it is very difficult for living entities encaged within this material body to have personal contact with Lord &#346;iva. Even great sages who have no material attachments do not contact him, despite their always being absorbed in meditation to attain his personal contact.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 4.24.18</B></A>: Lord &#346;iva, the most powerful demigod, second only to Lord Vishnu, is self-sufficient. Although he has nothing to aspire for in the material world, for the benefit of those in the material world he is always busily engaged everywhere and is accompanied by his dangerous energies like goddess K&#257;l&#299; and goddess Durg&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 4.24.19</B></A>: The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, because of their pious nature, all the sons of Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi very seriously accepted the words of their father with heart and soul, and with these words on their heads, they went toward the west to execute their father's order.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 4.24.20</B></A>: While traveling, the Pracet&#257;s happened to see a great reservoir of water which seemed almost as big as the ocean. The water of this lake was so calm and quiet that it seemed like the mind of a great soul, and its inhabitants, the aquatics, appeared very peaceful and happy to be under the protection of such a watery reservoir.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>SB 4.24.21</B></A>: In that great lake there were different types of lotus flowers. Some of them were bluish, and some of them were red. Some of them grew at night, some in the day and some, like the ind&#299;vara lotus flower, in the evening. Combined together, the lotus flowers filled the lake so full that the lake appeared to be a great mine of such flowers. Consequently, on the shores there were swans and cranes, cakrav&#257;ka, k&#257;randava and other beautiful water birds standing about.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>SB 4.24.22</B></A>: There were various trees and creepers on all sides of the lake, and there were mad bumblebees humming all about them. The trees appeared to be very jolly due to the sweet humming of the bumblebees, and the saffron, which was contained in the lotus flowers, was being thrown into the air. These all created such an atmosphere that it appeared as though a festival were taking place there.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>SB 4.24.23</B></A>: The sons of the King became very much amazed when they heard vibrations from various drums and kettledrums along with other orderly musical sounds pleasing to the ear.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24-25.htm"><B>SB 4.24.24-25</B></A>: The Pracet&#257;s were fortunate to see Lord &#346;iva, the chief of the demigods, emerging from the water with his associates. His bodily luster was just like molten gold, his throat was bluish, and he had three eyes, which looked very mercifully upon his devotees. He was accompanied by many musicians, who were glorifying him. As soon as the Pracet&#257;s saw Lord &#346;iva, they immediately offered their obeisances in great amazement and fell down at the lotus feet of the lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>SB 4.24.26</B></A>: Lord &#346;iva became very pleased with the Pracet&#257;s because generally Lord &#346;iva is the protector of pious persons and persons of gentle behavior. Being very much pleased with the princes, he began to speak as follows.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>SB 4.24.27</B></A>: Lord &#346;iva said: You are all the sons of King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi, and I wish all good fortune to you. I also know what you are going to do, and therefore I am visible to you just to show my mercy upon you.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 4.24.28</B></A>: Lord &#346;iva continued: Any person who is surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, the controller of everything &#8212; material nature as well as the living entity &#8212; is actually very dear to me.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>SB 4.24.29</B></A>: A person who executes his occupational duty properly for one hundred births becomes qualified to occupy the post of Brahm&#257;, and if he becomes more qualified, he can approach Lord &#346;iva. A person who is directly surrendered to Lord Krishna, or Vishnu, in unalloyed devotional service is immediately promoted to the spiritual planets. Lord &#346;iva and other demigods attain these planets after the destruction of this material world.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 4.24.30</B></A>: You are all devotees of the Lord, and as such I appreciate that you are as respectable as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. I know in this way that the devotees also respect me and that I am dear to them. Thus no one can be as dear to the devotees as I am.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 4.24.31</B></A>: Now I shall chant one mantra which is not only transcendental, pure and auspicious, but is the best prayer for anyone who is aspiring to attain the ultimate goal of life. When I chant this mantra, please hear it carefully and attentively.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>SB 4.24.32</B></A>: The great sage Maitreya continued: Out of his causeless mercy, the exalted personality Lord &#346;iva, a great devotee of Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana, continued to speak to the King's sons, who were standing with folded hands.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>SB 4.24.33</B></A>: Lord &#346;iva addressed the Supreme Personality of Godhead with the following prayer: O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all glories unto You. You are the most exalted of all self-realized souls. Since You are always auspicious for the self-realized, I wish that You be auspicious for me. You are worshipable by virtue of the all-perfect instructions You give. You are the Supersoul; therefore I offer my obeisances unto You as the supreme living being.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>SB 4.24.34</B></A>: My Lord, You are the origin of the creation by virtue of the lotus flower which sprouts from Your navel. You are the supreme controller of the senses and the sense objects, and You are also the all-pervading V&#257;sudeva. You are most peaceful, and because of Your self-illuminated existence, You are not disturbed by the six kinds of transformations.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm"><B>SB 4.24.35</B></A>: My dear Lord, You are the origin of the subtle material ingredients, the master of all integration as well as the master of all disintegration, the predominating Deity named Sa&#324;karshana, and the master of all intelligence, known as the predominating Deity Pradyumna. Therefore, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>SB 4.24.36</B></A>: My Lord, as the supreme directing Deity known as Aniruddha, You are the master of the senses and the mind. I therefore offer my obeisances unto You again and again. You are known as Ananta as well as Sa&#324;karshana because of Your ability to destroy the whole creation by the blazing fire from Your mouth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>SB 4.24.37</B></A>: My Lord, O Aniruddha, You are the authority by which the doors of the higher planetary systems and liberation are opened. You are always within the pure heart of the living entity. Therefore I offer my obeisances unto You. You are the possessor of semen which is like gold, and thus, in the form of fire, You help the Vedic sacrifices, beginning with c&#257;tur-hotra. Therefore I offer my obeisances unto You.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm"><B>SB 4.24.38</B></A>: My Lord, You are the provider of the Pitrilokas as well as all the demigods. You are the predominating deity of the moon and the master of all three Vedas. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because You are the original source of satisfaction for all living entities.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm"><B>SB 4.24.39</B></A>: My dear Lord, You are the gigantic universal form which contains all the individual bodies of the living entities. You are the maintainer of the three worlds, and as such You maintain the mind, senses, body, and air of life within them. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm"><B>SB 4.24.40</B></A>: My dear Lord, by expanding Your transcendental vibrations, You reveal the actual meaning of everything. You are the all-pervading sky within and without, and You are the ultimate goal of pious activities executed both within this material world and beyond it. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances again and again unto You.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm"><B>SB 4.24.41</B></A>: My dear Lord, You are the viewer of the results of pious activities. You are inclination, disinclination and their resultant activities. You are the cause of the miserable conditions of life caused by irreligion, and therefore You are death. I offer You my respectful obeisances.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm"><B>SB 4.24.42</B></A>: My dear Lord, You are the topmost of all bestowers of all benediction, the oldest and supreme enjoyer amongst all enjoyers. You are the master of all the worlds' metaphysical philosophy, for You are the supreme cause of all causes, Lord Krishna. You are the greatest of all religious principles, the supreme mind, and You have a brain which is never checked by any condition. Therefore I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto You.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm"><B>SB 4.24.43</B></A>: My dear Lord, You are the supreme controller of the worker, sense activities and results of sense activities [karma]. Therefore You are the controller of the body, mind and senses. You are also the supreme controller of egotism, known as Rudra. You are the source of knowledge and the activities of the Vedic injunctions.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm"><B>SB 4.24.44</B></A>: My dear Lord, I wish to see You exactly in the form that Your very dear devotees worship. You have many other forms, but I wish to see Your form that is especially liked by the devotees. Please be merciful upon me and show me that form, for only that form worshiped by the devotees can perfectly satisfy all the demands of the senses.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="45-46.htm"><B>SB 4.24.45-46</B></A>: The Lord's beauty resembles a dark cloud during the rainy season. As the rainfall glistens, His bodily features also glisten. Indeed, He is the sum total of all beauty. The Lord has four arms and an exquisitely beautiful face with eyes like lotus petals, a beautiful highly raised nose, a mind-attracting smile, a beautiful forehead and equally beautiful and fully decorated ears.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="47-48.htm"><B>SB 4.24.47-48</B></A>: The Lord is superexcellently beautiful on account of His open and merciful smile and Mis sidelong glance upon His devotees. His black hair is curly, and His garments, waving in the wind, appear like flying saffron pollen from lotus flowers. His glittering earrings, shining helmet, bangles, garland, ankle bells, waist belt and various other bodily ornaments combine with conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower to increase the natural beauty of the Kaustubha pearl on His chest.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm"><B>SB 4.24.49</B></A>: The Lord has shoulders just like a lion's. Upon these shoulders are garlands, necklaces and epaulets, and all of these are always glittering. Besides these, there is the beauty of the Kaustubha-mani pearl, and on the dark chest of the Lord there are streaks named &#346;r&#299;vatsa, which are signs of the goddess of fortune. The glittering of these streaks excels the beauty of the golden streaks on a gold-testing stone. Indeed, such beauty defeats a gold-testing stone.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm"><B>SB 4.24.50</B></A>: The Lord's abdomen is beautiful due to three ripples in the flesh. Being so round, His abdomen resembles the leaf of a banyan tree, and when He exhales and inhales, the movement of the ripples appears very, very beautiful. The coils within the navel of the Lord are so deep that it appears that the entire universe sprouted out of it and yet again wishes to go back.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm"><B>SB 4.24.51</B></A>: The lower part of the Lord's waist is dark and covered with yellow garments and a belt bedecked with golden embroidery work. His symmetrical lotus feet and the calves, thighs and joints of His legs are extraordinarily beautiful. Indeed, the Lord's entire body appears to be well built.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm"><B>SB 4.24.52</B></A>: My dear Lord, Your two lotus feet are so beautiful that they appear like two blossoming petals of the lotus flower which grows during the autumn season. Indeed, the nails of Your lotus feet emanate such a great effulgence that they immediately dissipate all the darkness in the heart of a conditioned soul. My dear Lord, kindly show me that form of Yours which always dissipates all kinds of darkness in the heart of a devotee. My dear Lord, You are the supreme spiritual master of everyone; therefore all conditioned souls covered with the darkness of ignorance can be enlightened by You as the spiritual master.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="53.htm"><B>SB 4.24.53</B></A>: My dear Lord, those who desire to purify their existence must always engage in meditation upon Your lotus feet, as described above. Those who are serious about executing their occupational duties and who want freedom from fear must take to this process of bhakti-yoga.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="54.htm"><B>SB 4.24.54</B></A>: My dear Lord, the king in charge of the heavenly kingdom is also desirous of obtaining the ultimate goal of life &#8212; devotional service. Similarly, You are the ultimate destination of those who identify themselves with You [aham brahm&#257;smi]. However, it is very difficult for them to attain You, whereas a devotee can very easily attain Your Lordship.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm"><B>SB 4.24.55</B></A>: My dear Lord, pure devotional service is even difficult for liberated persons to discharge, but devotional service alone can satisfy You. Who will take to other processes of self-realization if he is actually serious about the perfection of life?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="56.htm"><B>SB 4.24.56</B></A>: Simply by expansion of His eyebrows, invincible time personified can immediately vanquish the entire universe. However, formidable time does not approach the devotee who has taken complete shelter at Your lotus feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="57.htm"><B>SB 4.24.57</B></A>: If one by chance associates with a devotee, even for a fraction of a moment, he no longer is subject to attraction by the results of karma or jñ&#257;na. What interest then can he have in the benedictions of the demigods, who are subject to the laws of birth and death?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="58.htm"><B>SB 4.24.58</B></A>: My dear Lord, Your lotus feet are the cause of all auspicious things and the destroyer of all the contamination of sin. I therefore beg Your Lordship to bless me by the association of Your devotees, who are completely purified by worshiping Your lotus feet and who are so merciful upon the conditioned souls. I think that Your real benediction will be to allow me to associate with such devotees.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="59.htm"><B>SB 4.24.59</B></A>: The devotee whose heart has been completely cleansed by the process of devotional service and who is favored by Bhaktidev&#299; does not become bewildered by the external energy, which is just like a dark well. Being completely cleansed of all material contamination in this way, a devotee is able to understand very happily Your name, fame, form, activities, etc.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="60.htm"><B>SB 4.24.60</B></A>: My dear Lord, the impersonal Brahman spreads everywhere, like the sunshine or the sky. And that impersonal Brahman, which spreads throughout the universe and in which the entire universe is manifested, is You.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="61.htm"><B>SB 4.24.61</B></A>: My dear Lord, You have manifold energies, and these energies are manifested in manifold forms. With such energies You have also created this cosmic manifestation, and although You maintain it as if it were permanent, You ultimately annihilate it. Although You are never disturbed by such changes and alterations, the living entities are disturbed by them, and therefore they find the cosmic manifestation to be different or separated from You. My Lord, You are always independent, and I can clearly see this fact.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="62.htm"><B>SB 4.24.62</B></A>: My dear Lord, Your universal form consists of all five elements, the senses, mind, intelligence, false ego (which is material) and the Param&#257;tm&#257;, Your partial expansion, who is the director of everything. Yogis other than the devotees &#8212; namely the karma-yog&#299; and jñ&#257;na-yog&#299; &#8212; worship You by their respective actions in their respective positions. It is stated both in the Vedas and in the &#347;&#257;stras that are corollaries of the Vedas, and indeed everywhere, that it is only You who are to be worshiped. That is the expert version of all the Vedas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="63.htm"><B>SB 4.24.63</B></A>: My dear Lord, You are the only Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. Before the creation of this material world, Your material energy remains in a dormant condition. When Your material energy is agitated, the three qualities &#8212; namely goodness, passion and ignorance &#8212; act, and as a result the total material energy &#8212; egotism, ether, air, fire, water, earth and all the various demigods and saintly persons &#8212; becomes manifest. Thus the material world is created.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="64.htm"><B>SB 4.24.64</B></A>: My dear Lord, after creating by Your own potencies, You enter within the creation in four kinds of forms. Being within the hearts of the living entities, You know them and know how they are enjoying their senses. The so-called happiness of this material creation is exactly like the bees' enjoyment of honey after it has been collected in the honeycomb.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="65.htm"><B>SB 4.24.65</B></A>: My dear Lord, Your absolute authority cannot be directly experienced, but one can guess by seeing the activities of the world that everything is being destroyed in due course of time. The force of time is very strong, and everything is being destroyed by something else &#8212; just as one animal is being eaten by another animal. Time scatters everything, exactly as the wind scatters clouds in the sky.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="66.htm"><B>SB 4.24.66</B></A>: My dear Lord, all living entities within this material world are mad after planning for things, and they are always busy with a desire to do this or that. This is due to uncontrollable greed. The greed for material enjoyment is always existing in the living entity, but Your Lordship is always alert, and in due course of time You strike him, just as a snake seizes a mouse and very easily swallows him.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="67.htm"><B>SB 4.24.67</B></A>: My dear Lord, any learned person knows that unless he worships You, his entire life is spoiled. Knowing this, how could he give up worshiping Your lotus feet? Even our father and spiritual master, Lord Brahm&#257;, unhesitatingly worshiped You, and the fourteen Manus followed in his footsteps.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="68.htm"><B>SB 4.24.68</B></A>: My dear Lord, all actually learned persons know You as the Supreme Brahman and the Supersoul. Although the entire universe is afraid of Lord Rudra, who ultimately annihilates everything, for the learned devotees You are the fearless destination of all.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="69.htm"><B>SB 4.24.69</B></A>: My dear sons of the King, just execute your occupational duty as kings with a pure heart. Just chant this prayer fixing your mind on the lotus feet of the Lord. That will bring you all good fortune, for the Lord will be very much pleased with you.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="70.htm"><B>SB 4.24.70</B></A>: Therefore, O sons of the King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is situated in everyone's heart. He is also within your hearts. Therefore chant the glories of the Lord and always meditate upon Him continuously.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="71.htm"><B>SB 4.24.71</B></A>: My dear princes, in the form of a prayer I have delineated the yoga system of chanting the holy name.
