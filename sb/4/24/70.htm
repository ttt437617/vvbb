He is also within your hearts. Therefore chant the glories of the Lord and always meditate upon Him continuously.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The word asakrit is significant, for it means not just for a few minutes but continuously. That is the instruction given by Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu in His &#346;iksh&#257;shtaka 3. K&#299;rtan&#299;yah sad&#257; harih: [Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/adi/17/31.htm">adi 17.31</A>] "The holy name of the Lord should be chanted twenty-four hours daily." Therefore in this Krishna consciousness movement we request the devotees to chant at least sixteen rounds on their beads daily. Actually one has to chant twenty-four hours daily, just like Th&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa, who was chanting the Hare Krishna mantra three hundred thousand times daily. Indeed, he had no other business. Some of the Gosv&#257;m&#299;s, like Raghun&#257;tha d&#257;sa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, were also chanting very rigidly and also offering obeisances very rigidly. As stated in &#346;r&#299;niv&#257;s&#257;c&#257;rya's prayer to the six Gosv&#257;m&#299;s (Shad-gosv&#257;my-ashtaka): sa&#324;khy&#257;-p&#363;rvaka-n&#257;ma-g&#257;na-natibhih k&#257;l&#257;vas&#257;n&#299;-kritau. The word sa&#324;khy&#257;-p&#363;rvaka means "maintaining a numerical strength." Not only was Raghun&#257;tha d&#257;sa Gosv&#257;m&#299; chanting the holy name of the Lord, but he was also offering obeisances in the same prolific numbers.</P><P>Because the princes were ready to enter into some severe austerity in order to worship the Lord, Lord &#346;iva advised them to constantly chant of and meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is significant that Lord &#346;iva personally offered his prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead just as he was taught by his father, Lord Brahm&#257;. Similarly, he was also preaching to the princes according to the parampar&#257; system. One not only should practice the instructions received from the spiritual master but should also distribute this knowledge to one's disciples.</P><P>The words &#257;tm&#257;nam &#257;tma-stham sarva-bh&#363;teshv avasthitam are also significant. The Personality of Godhead is the origin of all living entities. Because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, He is the father of all of them. One can search out the Supreme Lord very easily within one's heart, for He is situated in every living entity's heart. In this verse the process of worshiping the Lord is considered to be very easy and complete, for anyone can sit down anywhere and in any condition of life and simply chant the holy names of the Lord. By chanting and hearing, one automatically engages in meditation.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="69.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="71.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
