Those who are serious about executing their occupational duties and who want freedom from fear must take to this process of bhakti-yoga.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>It is said that the transcendental name, form, pastimes and entourage of the Lord cannot be appreciated by the blunt material senses; therefore one has to engage himself in devotional service so that the senses may be purified and one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here, however, it is indicated that those who are constantly engaged in meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord are certainly purified of the material contamination of the senses and are thus able to see the Supreme Lord face to face. The word "meditation" is very popular in this age amongst the common people, but they do not know the actual meaning of meditation. However, from Vedic literature we learn that the yog&#299;s are always absorbed in meditation upon the lotus feet of the Lord. Dhy&#257;n&#257;vasthita-tad-gatena manas&#257; pa&#347;yanti yam yoginah (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/12/13/1.htm">12.13.1</A>). This is the real business of the yog&#299;s: to think of the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord &#346;iva therefore advises that one who is actually serious about purification must engage himself in this type of meditation or in the mystic yoga system, which will help him not only to see the Lord within constantly but to see Him face to face and become His associate in Vaikunthaloka or Goloka Vrind&#257;vana.</P><P>The word sva-dharmam (as in sva-dharmam anutishthat&#257;m) indicates that the system of varn&#257;&#347;rama &#8212; which indicates the occupational duties of the br&#257;hmana, kshatriya, vai&#347;ya and &#347;&#363;dra and which is the perfect institution for humanity &#8212; must be supported by bhakti-yoga if one at all wants security in life. Generally people think that simply by executing the occupational duties of a br&#257;hmana, kshatriya, vai&#347;ya or &#347;&#363;dra or the duty of a brahmac&#257;r&#299;, grihastha, v&#257;naprastha or sanny&#257;s&#299; one becomes fearless or securely attains liberation, but factually unless all these occupational duties are accompanied by bhakti-yoga, one cannot become fearless. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; there are descriptions of karma-yoga, jñ&#257;na-yoga, bhakti-yoga, dhy&#257;na-yoga, etc., but unless one comes to the point of bhakti-yoga, these other yogas cannot help one attain the highest perfection of life. In other words, bhakti-yoga is the only means for liberation. We find this conclusion also in Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita in a discussion between Lord Caitanya and R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya regarding a human being's liberation from this material world. In that discussion R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya referred to the execution of varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma, and Lord Caitanya indicated that the varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma was simply external (eho b&#257;hya). Lord Caitanya wanted to impress upon R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya that simply by executing the duties of varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma one is not guaranteed liberation. Finally R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya referred to the process of bhakti-yoga: sth&#257;ne sthit&#257;h &#347;ruti-gat&#257;m tanu-v&#257;&#324;-manobhih (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/10/14/3.htm">10.14.3</A>). Regardless of one's condition of life, if he practices bhakti-yoga, which begins with hearing (&#347;ruti-gat&#257;m) the transcendental messages of the Lord through the mouths of devotees, he gradually conquers the unconquerable God.</P><P>God is known to be unconquerable, but one who submissively hears the words of a self-realized soul conquers the unconquerable. The conclusion is that if one is serious about liberation, he not only should execute the occupational duties of varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma but should also engage in bhakti-yoga by beginning hearing from a realized soul. This process will help the devotee conquer the unconquerable Supreme Personality of Godhead and become His associate after giving up the material body.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="54.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
