Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Antardh&#257;na was very liberal, he did not kill Indra while the demigod was stealing his father's horse at the sacrifice.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>It is understood from various scriptures and pur&#257;nas that the King of heaven, Indra, was very expert in stealing and kidnapping. He could steal anything without being visible to the proprietor, and he could kidnap anyone's wife without being detected. Once he raped the wife of Gautama Muni by using his disappearing art, and similarly by becoming invisible he stole the horse of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prithu. Although in human society such activities are considered abominable, the demigod Indra was not considered to be degraded by them. Although Antardh&#257;na could understand that King Indra was stealing the horse from his father, he did not kill Indra, for he knew that if one who is very powerful sometimes commits an abominable act, it should be disregarded. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/30.htm">9.30</A>) it is clearly stated:</P><P>api cet su-dur&#257;c&#257;ro</P><P CLASS=n>bhajate m&#257;m ananya-bh&#257;k</P><P CLASS=n>s&#257;dhur eva sa mantavyah</P><P CLASS=n>samyag vyavasito hi sah</P><P>Thus the Lord says that even if a devotee commits an abominable act, he should be considered a s&#257;dhu, or a pious man, because of his unflinching devotion to the Lord. The devotees of the Lord never willingly commit any sinful act, but sometimes they commit something abominable due to their previous habits. Such acts should not be taken very seriously, however, because the devotees of the Lord are very powerful, whether they are on the heavenly planets or on this planet. If by chance they commit something abominable, it should not be taken into account, but should be overlooked.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
