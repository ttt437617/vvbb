Although the planet earth was frightened, she made up her mind and began to speak as follows in order to convince the King.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>SB 4.18.2</B></A>: My dear Lord, please pacify your anger completely and hear patiently whatever I submit before you. Please turn your kind attention to this.

Indeed, I am being neglected by kings who are not punishing these rascals who have turned into thieves by using grains for sense gratification. Consequently I have hidden all these seeds, which were meant for the performance of sacrifice.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 4.18.8</B></A>: Due to being stocked for a very long time, all the grain seeds within me have certainly deteriorated.
