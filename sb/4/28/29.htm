After conquering other princes, he married the daughter of King Vidarbha.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>It is customary among kshatriyas for a princess to be offered under certain conditions. For instance, Draupad&#299; was offered in marriage to one who could pierce a fish with an arrow simply by seeing the reflection of that fish. Krishna married one of His queens after conquering seven strong bulls. The Vedic system is for a daughter of a king to be offered under certain conditions. Vaidarbh&#299;, the daughter of Vidarbha, was offered to a great devotee and powerful king. Since King Malayadhvaja was both a powerful king and great devotee, he fulfilled all the requirements. The name Malayadhvaja signifies a great devotee who stands as firm as Malaya Hill and, through his propaganda, makes other devotees similarly as firm. Such a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata can prevail over the opinions of all others. A strong devotee makes propaganda against all other spiritual conceptions &#8212; namely jñ&#257;na, karma and yoga. With his devotional flag unfurled, he always stands fast to conquer other conceptions of transcendental realization. Whenever there is an argument between a devotee and a nondevotee, the pure, strong devotee comes out victorious.</P><P>The word p&#257;ndya comes from the word pand&#257;, meaning "knowledge." Unless one is highly learned, he cannot conquer nondevotional conceptions. The word para means "transcendental," and pura means "city." The para-pura is Vaikuntha, the kingdom of God, and the word jaya refers to one who can conquer. This means that a pure devotee, who is strong in devotional service and who has conquered all nondevotional conceptions, can also conquer the kingdom of God. In other words, one can conquer the kingdom of God, Vaikuntha, only by rendering devotional service. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called ajita, meaning that no one can conquer Him, but a devotee, by strong devotional service and sincere attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can easily conquer Him. Lord Krishna is fear personified for everyone, but He voluntarily agreed to fear the stick of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. Krishna, God, cannot be conquered by anyone but His devotee. Such a devotee kindly married the daughter of King Vidarbha.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
