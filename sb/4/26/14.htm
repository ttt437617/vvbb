When a man becomes refreshed by association with devotees and awakes to Krishna consciousness, he consults the activities of his mind &#8212; namely thinking, feeling and willing &#8212; and decides whether he should return to his material activities or stay steady in spiritual consciousness. The word ku&#347;alam refers to that which is auspicious. One can make his home perfectly auspicious when he engages in devotional service to Lord Vishnu. When one is engaged in activities other than vishnu-bhakti, or in other words when one is engaged in material activities, he is always filled with anxieties. A sane man should consult his mind, its thinking, feeling and willing processes, and decide how these processes should be utilized. If one always thinks of Krishna, feels how to serve Him and wills to execute the order of Krishna, it should be known that he has taken good instruction from his intelligence, which is called the mother. Although the King was refreshed, he nonetheless inquired about his wife. Thus he was consulting, thinking and willing how he could return to his steady good consciousness. The mind may suggest that by vishaya-bhoga, or sense enjoyment, one can become happy, but when one becomes advanced in Krishna consciousness, he does not derive happiness from material activities. This is explained in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/2/59.htm">2.59</A>):</P><P>vishay&#257; vinivartante</P><P CLASS=n>nir&#257;h&#257;rasya dehinah</P><P CLASS=n>rasa-varjam raso 'py asya</P><P CLASS=n>param drishtv&#257; nivartate</P><P>"The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for sense objects remains.
