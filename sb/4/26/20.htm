Just as King Purañjana began to flatter his Queen, one should, by deliberate consideration, raise himself to the platform of Krishna consciousness. To attain such an end, one must touch the lotus feet of the spiritual master. Krishna consciousness cannot be achieved by self-endeavor. One must therefore approach a self-realized, Krishna conscious person and touch his lotus feet. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore said:</P><P>naish&#257;m matis t&#257;vad urukram&#257;&#324;ghrim</P><P CLASS=n>spri&#347;aty anarth&#257;pagamo yad-arthah</P><P CLASS=n>mah&#299;yas&#257;m p&#257;da-rajo-'bhishekam</P><P CLASS=n>nishkiñcan&#257;n&#257;m na vrin&#299;ta y&#257;vat</P><P>(Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/7/5/32.htm">7.5.32</A>)</P><P>One cannot come to the precincts of Krishna consciousness unless he touches the dust of the lotus feet of a person who has become a mah&#257;tm&#257;, a great devotee. This is the beginning of the surrendering process. Lord Krishna wants everyone to surrender unto Him, and this surrendering process begins when one touches the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. By sincerely rendering service to a bona fide spiritual master, one begins his spiritual life in Krishna consciousness. Touching the lotus feet of a spiritual master means giving up one's false prestige and unnecessarily puffed-up position in the material world. Those who remain in the darkness of material existence due to their falsely prestigious positions &#8212; so-called scientists and philosophers &#8212; are actually atheists. They do not know the ultimate cause of everything. Although bewildered, they are not ready to surrender themselves to the lotus feet of a person who knows things in their proper perspective. In other words, one cannot arouse Krishna consciousness simply by his own mental speculation. One must surrender to a bona fide spiritual master. Only this process will help one.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
