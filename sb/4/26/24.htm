I am prepared to give such a person punishment as long as he does not belong to the br&#257;hmana caste. But for the servant of Muraripu [Krishna], I excuse no one within or beyond these three worlds. No one can freely move after offending you, for I am prepared to punish him.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>According to Vedic civilization, a br&#257;hmana, or one who is properly qualified to understand the Absolute Truth &#8212; that is, one belonging to the most intelligent social order &#8212; as well as the devotee of Lord Krishna, who is known as Muradvisha, enemy of a demon named Mura, is not subject to the rules and regulations of the state. In other words, upon breaking the laws of the state, everyone can be punished by the government except the br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas. Br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas never transgress the laws of the state or the laws of nature because they know perfectly well the resultant reactions caused by such law-breaking. Even though they may sometimes appear to violate the laws, they are not to be punished by the king. This instruction was given to King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhishat by N&#257;rada Muni. King Purañjana was a representative of King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhishat, and N&#257;rada Muni was reminding King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhishat of his forefather, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prithu, who never chastised a br&#257;hmana or a Vaishnava.</P><P>One's pure intelligence, or pure Krishna consciousness, becomes polluted by material activities. Pure consciousness can be revived by the process of sacrifice, charity, pious activities, etc., but when one pollutes his Krishna consciousness by offending a br&#257;hmana or a Vaishnava, it is very difficult to revive. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has described the vaishnava-apar&#257;dha, or offense to a Vaishnava, as "the mad elephant offense." One should be very careful not to offend a Vaishnava or a br&#257;hmana. Even the great yog&#299; Durv&#257;s&#257; was harassed by the Sudar&#347;ana cakra when he offended the Vaishnava Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha, who was neither a br&#257;hmana nor a sanny&#257;s&#299; but an ordinary householder. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha was a Vaishnava, and consequently Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni was chastised.</P><P>The conclusion is that if Krishna consciousness is covered by material sins, one can eliminate the sins simply by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, but if one pollutes his Krishna consciousness by offending a br&#257;hmana or a Vaishnava, one cannot revive it until one properly atones for the sin by pleasing the offended Vaishnava or br&#257;hmana. This was the course that Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni had to follow, for he surrendered unto Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha. A vaishnava-apar&#257;dha cannot be atoned for by any means other than by begging the pardon of the offended Vaishnava.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
