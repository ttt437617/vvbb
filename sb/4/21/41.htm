While performing a fire sacrifice, one pronounces the word sv&#257;h&#257; in mantras such as indr&#257;ya sv&#257;h&#257; and &#257;dity&#257;ya sv&#257;h&#257;. These mantras are uttered to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead through demigods such as Indra and &#256;ditya, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead says:</P><P>n&#257;ham tishth&#257;mi vaikunthe</P><P CLASS=n>yogin&#257;m hridayeshu v&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>tatra tishth&#257;mi n&#257;rada</P><P CLASS=n>yatra g&#257;yanti mad-bhakt&#257;h</P><P>"I am not in Vaikuntha nor in the hearts of the yog&#299;s. I remain where My devotees engage in glorifying My activities." It is to be understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not leave the company of His devotees.</P><P>Fire is certainly devoid of life, but devotees and br&#257;hmanas are the living representatives of the Supreme Lord. Therefore to feed br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas is to feed the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly. It may be concluded that instead of offering fire sacrifices, one should offer foodstuffs to br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas, for that process is more effective than fire yajña. The vivid example of this principle in action was given by Advaita Prabhu. When He performed the &#347;r&#257;ddha ceremony for His father, He first of all called Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura and offered him food. It is the practice that after finishing the &#347;r&#257;ddha ceremony, one should offer food to an elevated br&#257;hmana. But Advaita Prabhu offered food first to Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura, who had taken his birth in a Muhammadan family. Therefore Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura asked Advaita Prabhu why He was doing something which might jeopardize His position in br&#257;hmana society. Advaita Prabhu replied that He was feeding millions of first-class br&#257;hmanas by offering the food to Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura. He was prepared to talk with any learned br&#257;hmana on this point and prove definitely that by offering food to a pure devotee like Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura, He was equally as blessed as He would have been by offering food to thousands of learned br&#257;hmanas. When performing sacrifices, one offers oblations to the sacrificial fire, but when such oblations are offered to Vaishnavas, they are certainly more effective.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
