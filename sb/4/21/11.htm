Because he was very opulent, it appeared that he was enjoying his destined fortune in order to diminish the results of his past pious activities.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The terms "pious" and "impious" are applicable only in reference to the activities of an ordinary living being. But Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prithu was a directly empowered incarnation of Lord Vishnu; therefore he was not subject to the reactions of pious or impious activities. As we have already explained previously, when a living being is specifically empowered by the Supreme Lord to act for a particular purpose, he is called a &#347;akty&#257;ve&#347;a-avat&#257;ra. Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was not only a &#347;akty&#257;ve&#347;a-avat&#257;ra but also a great devotee. A devotee is not subjected to the reactions resulting from past deeds. In the Brahma-samhit&#257; it is said, karm&#257;ni nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh&#257;j&#257;m: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/54.htm">Bs. 5.54</A>] for devotees the results of past pious and impious activities are nullified by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words &#257;rabdh&#257;n eva mean "as if achieved by past deeds," but in the case of Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja there was no question of reaction to past deeds, and thus the word eva is used here to indicate comparison to ordinary persons. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; the Lord says, avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;m m&#363;dh&#257;h. This means that sometimes people misunderstand an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be an ordinary man. The Supreme Godhead, His incarnations or His devotees may pose themselves as ordinary men, but they are never to be considered as such. Nor should an ordinary man not supported by authorized statements of the &#347;&#257;stras and &#257;c&#257;ryas be accepted as an incarnation or devotee. By the evidence of &#347;&#257;stra, San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; detected Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu to be a direct incarnation of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although Lord Caitanya never disclosed the fact. It is therefore generally recommended that the &#257;c&#257;rya, or guru, should not be accepted as an ordinary man.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
