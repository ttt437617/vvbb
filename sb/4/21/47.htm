The rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in expectation of a good reward is deprecated by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja as mercantile business. Because Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was a Vaishnava, he did not ask a benediction for his personal self but was very affectionate toward his father. Although his father tortured him and would have killed him had he himself not been killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja begged pardon for him from the Lord. This favor was immediately granted by the Lord, and Hiranyaka&#347;ipu was delivered from the darkest region of hellish life, and he returned back home, back to Godhead, by the grace of his son. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is the topmost example of a Vaishnava, who is always compassionate toward sinful persons suffering a hellish life within this material world. Krishna is therefore known as para-duhkha-duhkh&#299; krip&#257;mbudhih, or one who is compassionate toward others' suffering and who is an ocean of mercy. Like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, all pure devotees of the Lord come to this material world with full compassion to deliver the sinful. They undergo all kinds of tribulations, suffering them with tolerance, because that is another qualification of a Vaishnava, who tries to deliver all sinful persons from the hellish conditions of material existence. Vaishnavas are therefore offered the following prayer:</P><P>v&#257;ñch&#257;-kalpatarubhya&#347; ca</P><P CLASS=n>krip&#257;-sindhubhya eva ca</P><P CLASS=n>patit&#257;n&#257;m p&#257;vanebhyo</P><P CLASS=n>vaishnavebhyo namo namah</P><P>The chief concern of a Vaishnava is to deliver the fallen souls.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
