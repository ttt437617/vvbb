In this world there is no fruitive activity superior to serving the br&#257;hmana class, for this can bring pleasure to the demigods, for whom the many sacrifices are recommended.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/2/65.htm">2.65</A>) it is said: pras&#257;de sarva-duhkh&#257;n&#257;m h&#257;nir asyopaj&#257;yate. Unless one is self-satisfied, he cannot be free from the miserable conditions of material existence. Therefore it is essential to render service to the br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas to achieve the perfection of self-satisfaction. &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura therefore says:</P><P>t&#257;&#324;dera carana sevi bhakta-sane v&#257;sa</P><P CLASS=n>janame janame haya, ei abhil&#257;sha</P><P>"Birth after birth I desire to serve the lotus feet of the &#257;c&#257;ryas and live in a society of devotees." A spiritual atmosphere can be maintained only by living in a society of devotees and by serving the orders of the &#257;c&#257;ryas. The spiritual master is the best br&#257;hmana. At present, in the age of Kali, it is very difficult to render service to the br&#257;hmana-kula, or the br&#257;hmana class. The difficulty, according to the Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;na, is that demons, taking advantage of Kali-yuga, have taken birth in br&#257;hmana families. R&#257;kshas&#257;h kalim &#257;&#347;ritya j&#257;yante brahma-yonishu (Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;na). In other words, in this age there are many so-called caste br&#257;hmanas and caste Gosv&#257;m&#299;s who, taking advantage of the &#347;&#257;stra and of the innocence of people in general, claim to be br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas by hereditary right. One will not derive any benefit by rendering service to such false br&#257;hmana-kulas. One must therefore take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and his associates and should also render service to them, for such activity will greatly help the neophyte in attaining full satisfaction. This has been very clearly explained by &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura in his explanation of the verse vyavas&#257;y&#257;tmik&#257; buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/2/41.htm">Bg. 2.41</A>). By actually following the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga as recommended by &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura, one can very quickly come to the transcendental platform of liberation, as explained in this verse (atyanta-&#347;amam).</P><P>The particular use of the word anativelam ("without delay") is very significant because simply by serving br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas one can get liberation. There is no need to undergo severe penances and austerities. The vivid example of this is N&#257;rada Muni himself. In his previous birth, he was simply a maidservant's son, but he got the opportunity to serve exalted br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas, and thus in his next life he not only became liberated, but became famous as the supreme spiritual master of the entire Vaishnava disciplic succession. According to the Vedic system, therefore, it is customarily recommended that after performing a ritualistic ceremony, one should feed the br&#257;hmanas.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
