I therefore wish that the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His associates be pleased with the br&#257;hmana class, with the cows and with me.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped with the prayer namo brahmanya-dev&#257;ya go-br&#257;hmana-hit&#257;ya ca. Thus it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead respects and protects the br&#257;hmanas and brahminical culture, as well as the cows; in other words, wherever there are br&#257;hmanas and brahminical culture, there are cows and cow protection. In a society or civilization in which there are no br&#257;hmanas or brahminical culture, cows are treated as ordinary animals and slaughtered, at the sacrifice of human civilization. The specific mention of the word gav&#257;m by Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is significant because the Lord is always associated with cows and His devotees. In pictures Lord Krishna is always seen with cows and His associates such as the cowherd boys and the gop&#299;s. Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot be alone. Therefore Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said, s&#257;nucara&#347; ca, indicating that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always associated with His followers and devotees.</P><P>A devotee acquires all the good qualities of the demigods; he is gun&#257;yanam, the reservoir of all good qualities. His only asset is good behavior, and he is grateful. Gratitude for the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is one of the qualities of br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas. Everyone should feel grateful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He is maintaining all living entities and supplying all their necessities. As stated in the Vedas (Katha Upanishad <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/2/2/13">2.2.13</A>), eko bah&#363;n&#257;m yo vidadh&#257;ti k&#257;m&#257;n: the supreme one is supplying all necessities to the living entities. The living entity who is therefore grateful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly qualified with good characteristics.</P><P>The word vriddh&#257;&#347;rayam is very significant in this verse. Vriddha refers to one who is advanced in knowledge. There are two kinds of old men &#8212; he who is advanced in years and he who is experienced in knowledge. One who is advanced in knowledge is actually vriddha (jñ&#257;na-vriddha); one does not become vriddha simply by advancing in age. Vriddh&#257;&#347;rayam, a person who takes shelter of a superior person who is advanced in knowledge, can acquire all the good qualities of a br&#257;hmana and be trained in good behavior. When one actually attains good qualities, becomes grateful for the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and takes shelter of a bona fide spiritual master, he is endowed with all opulence. Such a person is a br&#257;hmana or Vaishnava. Therefore Prithu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja invokes the blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with His associates, devotees, Vaishnavas, br&#257;hmanas and cows.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
