His arms were full and broad and his eyes as bright as the rising sun. His nose was straight, his face very beautiful and his personality grave. His teeth were set beautifully in his smiling face.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Amongst the four social orders (br&#257;hmanas, kshatriyas, vai&#347;yas and &#347;&#363;dras), the kshatriyas, both men and women, are generally very beautiful. As will be apparent from the following verses, it is to be concluded that not only were Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prithu's bodily features attractive, as described here, but he had specific all-auspicious signs in his bodily construction.</P><P>As it is said, "The face is the index of the mind." One's mental constitution is exhibited by his facial features. The bodily features of a particular person are exhibited in accordance with his past deeds, for according to one's past deeds, his next bodily features &#8212; whether in human society, animal society or demigod society &#8212; are determined. This is proof of the transmigration of the soul through different types of bodies.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
