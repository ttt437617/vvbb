Thus there is no need for them to be killed again by an exalted personality like you.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Persons who are materialistic and always engaged in fruitive activities for material profit cannot endure seeing the flourishing life of others. Except for a few persons in Krishna consciousness, the entire world is full of such envious persons, who are perpetually full of anxieties because they are attached to the material body and are without self-realization. Since their hearts are always filled with anxiety, it is understood that they have already been killed by providence. Thus Lord &#346;iva, as a self-realized Vaishnava, was advised not to kill Daksha. A Vaishnava is described as para-duhkha-duhkh&#299; because although he is never distressed in any condition of life, he is distressed to see others in a distressed condition. Vaishnavas, therefore, should not try to kill by any action of the body or mind, but should try to revive the Krishna consciousness of others out of compassion for them. The Krishna consciousness movement has been started to deliver the envious persons of the world from the clutches of m&#257;y&#257;, and even though devotees are sometimes put into trouble, they push on the Krishna consciousness movement in all tolerance. Lord Caitanya advises:</P><P>trin&#257;d api sun&#299;cena</P><P CLASS=n>taror api sahishnun&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>am&#257;nin&#257; m&#257;nadena</P><P CLASS=n>k&#299;rtan&#299;yah sad&#257; harih</P><P CLASS=n>[Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/adi/17/31.htm">adi 17.31</A>]</P><P>"One can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking himself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than the tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready to offer all respects to others. ln such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly." (&#346;iksh&#257;shtaka 3)</P><P>A Vaishnava should follow the examples of such Vaishnavas as Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura, Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu and also Lord Jesus Christ. There is no need to kill anyone who has already been killed. But it should be noted herewith that a Vaishnava should not tolerate the blaspheming of Vishnu or Vaishnavas, although he should tolerate personal insults to himself.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
