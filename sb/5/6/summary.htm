He was not attached to His body even when it was being burned up in a forest fire. When the seed of fruitive activity is burned by the fire of knowledge, the spiritual properties and mystic powers are automatically manifest, yet bhakti-yoga is not affected by these mystic powers. An ordinary yog&#299; is captivated by mystic powers and his progress checked; therefore a perfect yog&#299; does not welcome them. Because the mind is restless and undependable, it must remain always under control. Even the mind of the advanced yog&#299; Saubhari created such a disturbance that he lost his yogic mystic powers. Due to a restless mind, even a very advanced yog&#299; can fall down. The mind is so restless that it induces even a perfect yog&#299; to be controlled by the senses. Therefore Lord Rishabhadeva, for the instruction of all yog&#299;s, showed the process of quitting the body. While traveling in South India, through the provinces of Karn&#257;ta, Ko&#324;ka, Ve&#324;ka and Kutaka, Lord Rishabhadeva arrived in the neighborhood of Kutak&#257;cala. Suddenly there was a forest fire that burned the forest and Lord Rishabhadeva's body to ashes. The pastimes of Lord Rishabhadeva as a liberated soul were known by the King of Ko&#324;ka, Ve&#324;ka and Kutaka. This King's name was Arhat. He later became captivated by the illusory energy, and in this condition he set forth the basic principles of Jainism. Lord Rishabhadeva set forth the principles of religion that can free one from material bondage, and He put an end to all kinds of atheistic activities. On this earth, the place known as Bh&#257;rata-varsha was a very pious land because the Supreme Lord appeared there when He wanted to incarnate.</P><P>Lord Rishabhadeva neglected all the mystic powers for which the so-called yog&#299;s hanker. Because of the beauty of devotional service, devotees are not at all interested in so-called mystic power. The master of all yogic power, Lord Krishna, can exhibit all powers on behalf of His devotee. Devotional service is more valuable than yogic mystic powers. Devotees who are sometimes misled aspire for liberation and mystic powers. The Supreme Lord gives these devotees whatever they desire, but they cannot attain the most important function of devotional service. Devotional service to the Lord is guaranteed for those who do not desire liberation and mystic power.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../5/35.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
