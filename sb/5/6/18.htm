He is your spiritual master, worshipable Deity, friend, and the director of your activities. To say nothing of this, He sometimes serves your family as a messenger or servant. This means He worked just as ordinary servants do. Those engaged in getting the Lord's favor attain liberation from the Lord very easily, but He does not very easily give the opportunity to render direct service unto Him.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>While instructing Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; thought it wise to encourage the King because the King might be thinking of the glorious position of various royal dynasties. Especially glorious is the dynasty of Priyavrata, in which the Supreme Lord Rishabhadeva incarnated. Similarly, the family of Utt&#257;nap&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the father of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dhruva, is also glorious due to King Prithu's taking birth in it. The dynasty of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Raghu is glorified because Lord R&#257;macandra appeared in that family. As far as the Yadu and Kuru dynasties are concerned, they existed simultaneously, but of the two, the Yadu dynasty was more glorious due to the appearance of Lord Krishna. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit might have been thinking that the Kuru dynasty was not as fortunate as the others because the Supreme Lord did not appear in that family, neither as Krishna, Lord R&#257;macandra, Lord Rishabhadeva or Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Prithu. Therefore Par&#299;kshit Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was encouraged by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; in this particular verse.</P><P>The Kuru dynasty may be considered more glorious due to the presence of devotees like the five P&#257;ndavas, who rendered unalloyed devotional service. Although Lord Krishna did not appear in the Kuru dynasty. He was so obligated to the P&#257;ndavas' devotional service that He acted as a maintainer of the family and spiritual master of the P&#257;ndavas. Although He took birth in the Yadu dynasty, Lord Krishna was more affectionate to the P&#257;ndavas. By His actions, Lord Krishna proved that He was more inclined to the Kuru dynasty than the Yadu dynasty. Indeed, Lord Krishna, indebted to the P&#257;ndavas' devotional service, sometimes acted as their messenger, and He guided them through many dangerous situations. Therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit should not have been saddened because Lord Krishna did not appear in his family. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always inclined toward His pure devotees, and by His action it is clear that liberation is not very important for the devotees. Lord Krishna easily gives one liberation, but He does not so easily give one the facility to become a devotee. Muktim dad&#257;ti karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam. Directly or indirectly, it is proved that bhakti-yoga is the basis for the supreme relationship with the Supreme Lord. It is far superior to liberation. For a pure devotee of the Lord, mukti is automatically attained.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
