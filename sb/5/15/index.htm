These people, who were actually atheistic and of bad character, took up the Vedic principles in an imaginary, infamous way to support their activities. Thus these sinful people accepted Sumati as Lord Buddhadeva and propagated the theory that everyone should follow the principles of Sumati. In this way they were carried away by mental concoction.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>SB 5.15.2</B></A>: From Sumati, a son named Devat&#257;jit was born by the womb of his wife named Vriddhasen&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>SB 5.15.3</B></A>: Thereafter, in the womb of &#256;sur&#299;, the wife of Devat&#257;jit, a son named Devadyumna was begotten. Devadyumna begot in the womb of his wife, Dhenumat&#299;, a son named Parameshth&#299;. Parameshth&#299; begot a son named Prat&#299;ha in the womb of his wife, Suvarcal&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 5.15.4</B></A>: King Prat&#299;ha personally propagated the principles of self-realization. In this way, not only was he purified, but he became a great devotee of the Supreme Person, Lord Vishnu, and directly realized Him.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 5.15.5</B></A>: In the womb of his wife Suvarcal&#257;, Prat&#299;ha begot three sons, named Pratihart&#257;, Prastot&#257; and Udg&#257;t&#257;. These three sons were very expert in performing Vedic rituals. Pratihart&#257; begot two sons, named Aja and Bh&#363;m&#257;, in the womb of his wife, named Stut&#299;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 5.15.6</B></A>: In the womb of his wife, Rishikuly&#257;, King Bh&#363;m&#257; begot a son named Udg&#299;tha. From Udg&#299;tha's wife, Devakuly&#257;, a son named Prast&#257;va was born, and Prast&#257;va begot a son named Vibhu through his wife, Niyuts&#257;. In the womb of his wife, Rat&#299;, Vibhu begot a son named Prithushena. Prithushena begot a son named Nakta in the womb of his wife, named &#256;k&#363;ti. Nakta's wife was Druti, and from her womb the great King Gaya was born. Gaya was very famous and pious; he was the best of saintly kings. Lord Vishnu and His expansions, who are meant to protect the universe, are always situated in the transcendental mode of goodness, known as vi&#347;uddha-sattva. Being the direct expansion of Lord Vishnu, King Gaya was also situated in the vi&#347;uddha-sattva. Because of this, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya was fully equipped with transcendental knowledge. Therefore he was called Mah&#257;purusha.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 5.15.7</B></A>: King Gaya gave full protection and security to the citizens so that their personal property would not be disturbed by undesirable elements. He also saw that there was sufficient food to feed all the citizens. [This is called poshana.] He would sometimes distribute gifts to the citizens to satisfy them. [This is called pr&#299;nana.] He would sometimes call meetings and satisfy the citizens with sweet words. [This is called upal&#257;lana.] He would also give them good instructions on how to become first-class citizens. [This is called anu&#347;&#257;sana.] Such were the characteristics of King Gaya's royal order. Besides all this, King Gaya was a householder who strictly observed the rules and regulations of household life. He performed sacrifices and was an unalloyed pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was called Mah&#257;purusha because as a king he gave the citizens all facilities, and as a householder he executed all his duties so that at the end he became a strict devotee of the Supreme Lord. As a devotee, he was always ready to give respect to other devotees and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord. This is the bhakti-yoga process. Due to all these transcendental activities, King Gaya was always free from the bodily conception. He was full in Brahman realization, and consequently he was always jubilant. He did not experience material lamentation. Although he was perfect in all respects, he was not proud, nor was he anxious to rule the kingdom.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 5.15.8</B></A>: My dear King Par&#299;kshit, those who are learned scholars in the histories of the Pur&#257;nas eulogize and glorify King Gaya with the following verses.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 5.15.9</B></A>: The great King Gaya used to perform all kinds of Vedic rituals. He was highly intelligent and expert in studying all the Vedic literatures. He maintained the religious principles and possessed all kinds of opulence. He was a leader among gentlemen and a servant of the devotees. He was a totally qualified plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore who could equal him in the performance of gigantic ritualistic ceremonies?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 5.15.10</B></A>: All the chaste and honest daughters of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Daksha, such as &#346;raddh&#257;, Maitr&#299; and Day&#257;, whose blessings were always effective, bathed Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya with sanctified water. Indeed, they were very satisfied with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya. The planet earth personified came as a cow, and, as though she saw her calf, she delivered milk profusely when she saw all the good qualities of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya. In other words, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya was able to derive all benefits from the earth and thus satisfy the desires of his citizens. However, he personally had no desire.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 5.15.11</B></A>: Although King Gaya had no personal desire for sense gratification, all his desires were fulfilled by virtue of his performance of Vedic rituals. All the kings with whom Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya had to fight were forced to fight on religious principles. They were very satisfied with his fighting, and they would present all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, all the br&#257;hmanas in his kingdom were very satisfied with King Gaya's munificent charities. Consequently the br&#257;hmanas contributed a sixth of their pious activities for King Gaya's benefit in the next life.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 5.15.12</B></A>: In Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya's sacrifices, there was a great supply of the intoxicant known as soma. King Indra used to come and become intoxicated by drinking large quantities of soma-rasa. Also, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vishnu [the yajña-purusha] also came and personally accepted all the sacrifices offered unto Him with pure and firm devotion in the sacrificial arena.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 5.15.13</B></A>: When the Supreme Lord is pleased by a person's actions, automatically all the demigods, human beings, animals, birds, bees, creepers, trees, grass and all other living entities, beginning with Lord Brahm&#257;, are pleased. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Supersoul of everyone, and He is by nature fully pleased. Nonetheless, He came to the arena of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya and said, "I am fully pleased."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14-15.htm"><B>SB 5.15.14-15</B></A>: In the womb of Gayant&#299;, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya begot three sons, named Citraratha, Sugati and Avarodhana. In the womb of his wife &#362;rn&#257;, Citraratha begot a son named Samr&#257;t. The wife of Samr&#257;t was Utkal&#257;, and in her womb Samr&#257;t begot a son named Mar&#299;ci. In the womb of his wife Bindumat&#299;, Mar&#299;ci begot a son named Bindu. In the womb of his wife Saragh&#257;, Bindu begot a son named Madhu. In the womb of his wife named Suman&#257;, Madhu begot a son named V&#299;ravrata. In the womb of his wife Bhoj&#257;, V&#299;ravrata begot two sons named Manthu and Pramanthu. In the womb of his wife Saty&#257;, Manthu begot a son named Bhauvana, and in the womb of his wife D&#363;shan&#257;, Bhauvana begot a son named Tvasht&#257;. In the womb of his wife Virocan&#257;, Tvasht&#257; begot a son named Viraja. The wife of Viraja was Vish&#363;c&#299;, and in her womb Viraja begot one hundred sons and one daughter. Of all these sons, the son named &#346;atajit was predominant.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 5.15.16</B></A>: There is a famous verse about King Viraja. "Because of his high qualities and wide fame, King Viraja became the jewel of the dynasty of King Priyavrata, just as Lord Vishnu, by His transcendental potency, decorates and blesses the demigods."</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
