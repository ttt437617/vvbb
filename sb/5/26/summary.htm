As stated in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/3/27.htm">3.27</A>):</P><P>prakriteh kriyam&#257;n&#257;ni</P><P>gunaih karm&#257;ni sarva&#347;ah</P><P>aha&#324;k&#257;ra-vim&#363;dh&#257;tm&#257;</P><P>kart&#257;ham iti manyate</P><P>"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities, which are in actuality carried out by nature." The foolish person thinks he is independent of any law. He thinks there is no God or regulative principle and that he can do whatever he likes. Thus he engages in different sinful activities, and as a result, he is put into different hellish conditions life after life, to be punished by the laws of nature. The basic principle of his suffering is that he foolishly thinks himself independent, although he is strictly under the control of the laws of material nature. These laws act due to the influence of the three modes of nature, and therefore each human being also works under three different types of influence. According to how he acts, he suffers different reactions in his next life or in this life. Religious persons act differently from atheists, and therefore they suffer different reactions.</P><P>&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes the following twenty-eight hells: T&#257;misra, Andhat&#257;misra, Raurava, Mah&#257;raurava, Kumbh&#299;p&#257;ka. K&#257;las&#363;tra, Asi-patravana, S&#363;karamukha, Andhak&#363;pa, Krimibhojana. Sandam&#347;a, Taptas&#363;rmi, Vajrakantaka-&#347;&#257;lmal&#299;, Vaitaran&#299;, P&#363;yoda, Pr&#257;narodha, Vi&#347;asana, L&#257;l&#257;bhaksha, S&#257;ramey&#257;dana, Av&#299;ci, Ayahp&#257;na. Ksh&#257;rakardama, Rakshogana-bhojana, &#346;&#363;laprota, Danda&#347;&#363;ka. Avata-nirodhana, Pary&#257;vartana and S&#363;c&#299;mukha.</P><P>A person who steals another's money, wife or possessions is put into the hell known as T&#257;misra. A man who tricks someone and enjoys his wife is put into the extremely hellish condition known as Andhat&#257;misra. A foolish person absorbed in the bodily concept of life, who on the basis of this principle maintains himself or his wife and children by committing violence against other living entities, is put into the hell known as Raurava.

Therefore he can feel the suffering and happiness of other living beings. The human being bereft of his conscience, however, is prone to cause suffering for other living beings. The assistants of Yamar&#257;ja put such a person into the hell known as Andhak&#363;pa, where he receives proper punishment from his victims.

A person maddened by possessing riches and thus deeply absorbed in thinking of how to collect money is put into the hell known as S&#363;c&#299;mukha.</P><P>After describing the hellish planets, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes how pious persons are elevated to the highest planetary system, where the demigods live, and how they then come back again to this earth when the results of their pious activities are finished. Finally he describes the universal form of the Lord and glorifies the Lord's activities.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../25/15.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
