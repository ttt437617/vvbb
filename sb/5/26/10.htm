While working to maintain himself and his family, he may commit violence against other living entities. Such a person is forced to give up his body and his family at the time of death, when he suffers the reaction for his envy of other creatures by being thrown into the hell called Raurava.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam it is said:</P><P>yasy&#257;tma-buddhih kunape tri-dh&#257;tuke</P><P CLASS=n>sva-dh&#299;h kalatr&#257;dishu bhauma-ijya-dh&#299;h</P><P CLASS=n>yat-t&#299;rtha-buddhih salile na karhicij</P><P CLASS=n>janeshv abhijñeshu sa eva go-kharah</P><P>"One who accepts this bodily bag of three elements [bile, mucus and air] as his self, who has an affinity for an intimate relationship with his wife and children, who considers his land worshipable, who takes bath in the waters of the holy places of pilgrimage but never takes advantage of those persons who are in actual knowledge &#8212; he is no better than an ass or a cow." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/10/84/13.htm">10.84.13</A>) There are two classes of men absorbed in the material concept of life. Out of ignorance, a man in the first class thinks his body to be his self, and therefore he is certainly like an animal (sa eva go-kharah). The person in the second class, however, not only thinks his material body to be his self, but also commits all kinds of sinful activities to maintain his body. He cheats everyone to acquire money for his family and his self, and he becomes envious of others without reason. Such a person is thrown into the hell known as Raurava. If one simply considers his body to be his self, as do the animals, he is not very sinful. However, if one needlessly commits sins to maintain his body, he is put into the hell known as Raurava. This is the opinion of &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura. Although animals are certainly in the bodily concept of life, they do not commit any sins to maintain their bodies, mates or offspring. Therefore animals do not go to hell. However, when a human being acts enviously and cheats others to maintain his body, he is put into a hellish condition.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
