On the other hand, a person devoid of devotional service and engaged in material activities has no good qualities. Even if he is adept at the practice of mystic yoga or the honest endeavor of maintaining his family and relatives, he must be driven by his own mental speculations and must engage in the service of the Lord's external energy. How can there be any good qualities in such a man?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>As explained in the next verse, Krishna is the original source of all living entities. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/7.htm">15.7</A>), wherein Krishna says:</P><P>mamaiv&#257;m&#347;o j&#299;va-loke</P><P CLASS=n>j&#299;va-bh&#363;tah san&#257;tanah</P><P CLASS=n>manah shashth&#257;n&#299;ndriy&#257;ni</P><P CLASS=n>prakriti-sth&#257;ni karshati</P><P>"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." All living entities are part and parcel of Krishna, and therefore when they revive their original Krishna consciousness, they possess all the good qualities of Krishna in a small quantity. When one engages himself in the nine processes of devotional service (&#347;ravanam k&#299;rtanam vishnoh smaranam p&#257;da-sevanam/ arcanam vandanam d&#257;syam sakhyam &#257;tma-nivedanam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../7/5/23.htm">SB 7.5.23</A>]), one's heart becomes purified, and he immediately understands his relationship with Krishna. He then revives his original quality of Krishna consciousness.</P><P>In the &#256;di-l&#299;l&#257; of Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita, Chapter Eight, there is a description of some of the qualities of devotees. For example, &#346;r&#299; Pandita Harid&#257;sa is described as being very well-behaved, tolerant, peaceful, magnanimous and grave. In addition, he spoke very sweetly, his endeavors were very pleasing, he was always patient, he respected everyone, he always worked for everyone's benefit, his mind was free of duplicity, and he was completely devoid of all malicious activities. These are all originally qualities of Krishna, and when one becomes a devotee they automatically become manifest. &#346;r&#299; Krishnad&#257;sa Kavir&#257;ja, the author of Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita, says that all good qualities become manifest in the body of a Vaishnava and that only by the presence of these good qualities can one distinguish a Vaishnava from a non-Vaishnava. Krishnad&#257;sa Kavir&#257;ja lists the following twenty-six good qualities of a Vaishnava: (1) He is very kind to everyone. (2) He does not make anyone his enemy. (3) He is truthful. (4) He is equal to everyone. (5) No one can find any fault in him. (6) He is magnanimous. (7) He is mild. (8) He is always clean. (9) He is without possessions. (10) He works for everyone's benefit. (11) He is very peaceful. (12) He is always surrendered to Krishna. (13) He has no material desires. (14) He is very meek. (15) He is steady. (16) He controls his senses. (17) He does not eat more than required. (18) He is not influenced by the Lord's illusory energy. (19) He offers respect to everyone. (20) He does not desire any respect for himself. (21) He is very grave. (22) He is merciful. (23) He is friendly. (24) He is poetic. (25) He is expert. (26) He is silent.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
