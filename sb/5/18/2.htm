Again and again we offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Foolish materialistic persons do not know how they are being controlled and punished at every step by the laws of nature. They think they are very happy in the conditioned state of material life, not knowing the purpose of repeated birth, death, old age and disease. Therefore in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/15.htm">7.15</A>) Lord Krishna describes such materialistic persons as m&#363;dhas (rascals): na m&#257;m dushkritino m&#363;dh&#257;h prapadyante nar&#257;dham&#257;h. These m&#363;dhas do not know that if they want to purify themselves, they must worship Lord V&#257;sudeva (Krishna) by performing penances and austerities. This purification is the aim of human life. This life is not meant for blind indulgence in sense gratification. In the human form, the living being must engage himself in Krishna consciousness to purify his existence: tapo divyam putrak&#257; yena sattvam &#347;uddhyet. This is the instruction of King Rishabhadeva to His sons. In the human form of life, one must undergo all kinds of austerities to purify his existence. Yasm&#257;d brahma-saukhyam tv anantam. We are all seeking happiness, but because of our ignorance and foolishness, we cannot know what unobstructed happiness really is. Unobstructed happiness is called brahma-saukhya, spiritual happiness. Although we may get some so-called happiness in this material world, that happiness is temporary. The foolish materialists cannot understand this. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja points out, m&#257;y&#257;-sukh&#257;ya bharam udvahato vim&#363;dh&#257;n: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../7/9/43.htm">SB 7.9.43</A>] merely for temporary materialistic happiness, these rascals are making huge arrangements, and thus they are baffled life after life.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
