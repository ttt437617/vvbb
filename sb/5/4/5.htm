Understanding the popularity of his son, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi enthroned Him as the emperor of the world to give protection to the general populace in terms of the Vedic religious system. To do this, he entrusted Him into the hands of learned br&#257;hmanas, who would guide Him in administrating the government. Then Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi and his wife, Merudev&#299;, went to Badarik&#257;&#347;rama in the Himalaya Mountains, where the King engaged Himself very expertly in austerities and penances with great jubilation. In full sam&#257;dhi he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nara-N&#257;r&#257;yana, who is Krishna in His plenary expansion. By doing so, in course of time Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi was elevated to the spiritual world known as Vaikuntha.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi saw that his son Rishabhadeva was popular with the general populace and the governmental servants, he chose to install Him on the imperial throne. In addition, he wanted to entrust his son into the hands of the learned br&#257;hmanas. This means that a monarch was supposed to govern strictly according to Vedic principles under the guidance of learned br&#257;hmanas, who could advise Him according to the standard Vedic scriptures like Manu-smriti and similar &#347;&#257;stras. It is the duty of the king to rule the citizens according to Vedic principles. According to Vedic principles, society is divided into four categories &#8212; br&#257;hmana, kshatriya, vai&#347;ya and &#347;&#363;dra. C&#257;tur-varnyam may&#257; srishtam guna-karma-vibh&#257;ga&#347;ah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/13.htm">Bg. 4.13</A>]. After dividing society in this way, it is the king's duty to see that everyone executes Vedic principles according to his caste. A br&#257;hmana must perform the duty of a br&#257;hmana without cheating the public. It is not that one attains the name of a br&#257;hmana without the qualifications. It is the king's duty to see that everyone engages in his occupational duty according to Vedic principles. In addition, retirement at the end of life is compulsory. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi, although still a king. retired from family life and went with his wife to a place called Badarik&#257;&#347;rama in the Himalayas, where the Deity Nara-N&#257;r&#257;yana is worshiped. The words prasanna-nipunena tapas&#257; indicate that the King accepted all kinds of austerity very expertly and jubilantly. He did not at all mind leaving his comfortable life at home, although he was the emperor. Despite undergoing severe austerities and penances, he felt very pleased at Badarik&#257;&#347;rama, and he did everything there expertly. In this way, being fully absorbed in Krishna consciousness (sam&#257;dhi-yoga). always thinking of Krishna, V&#257;sudeva, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi attained success at the end of his life and was promoted to the spiritual world, Vaikunthaloka.</P><P>This is the way of Vedic life. One must stop the process of repeated birth and death and return home, back to Godhead. The words tan-mahim&#257;nam av&#257;pa are significant in this regard. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299; says that mahim&#257; means liberation in this life. We should act in such a way in this life that after giving up this body, we will become liberated from the bondage of repeated birth and death. This is called j&#299;van-mukti. &#346;r&#299;la V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya states that in the Ch&#257;ndogya Upanishad there are eight symptoms of a j&#299;van-mukta, a person who is already liberated even when living in this body. The first symptom of one so liberated is that he is freed from all sinful activity (apahata-p&#257;pa). As long as one is under the clutches of m&#257;y&#257; in the material energy, one has to engage in sinful activity. Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; describes such people as dushkritinah, which indicates that they are always engaged in sinful activity. One who is liberated in this life does not commit any sinful activities. Sinful activity involves illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Another symptom of a liberated person is vijara, which indicates that he is not subjected to the miseries of old age. Another symptom is vimrityu. A liberated person prepares himself in such a way that he does not take on any more material bodies, which are destined to die. In other words. he does not fall down again to repeat birth and death. Another symptom is vi&#347;oka, which indicates that he is callous to material distress and happiness. Another is vijighatsa, which indicates that he no longer desires material enjoyment. Another symptom is apip&#257;t&#257;, which means that he has no desire other than to engage in the devotional service of Krishna, his dearmost pursuable Lord. A further symptom is satya-k&#257;ma, which indicates that all his desires are directed to the Supreme Truth, Krishna. He does not want anything else. He is satya-sa&#324;kalpa. Whatever he desires is fulfilled by the grace of Krishna. First of all, he does not desire anything for his material benefit, and secondly if he desires anything at all, he simply desires to serve the Supreme Lord. That desire is fulfilled by the Lord's grace. That is called satya-sa&#324;kalpa. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; points out that the word mahim&#257; means returning to the spiritual world, back home, back to Vaikuntha. &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva says that the word mahim&#257; means that the devotee attains the qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called sadharma, or "the same quality." Just as Krishna is never born and never dies, His devotees who return to Godhead never die and never take birth within the material world.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
