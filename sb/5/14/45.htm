He gives the results of ritualistic activity. He is the protector of religious systems, the personification of mystic yoga, the source of all knowledge, the controller of the entire creation, and the Supersoul in every living entity. He is beautiful and attractive. I am quitting this body offering obeisances unto Him and hoping that I may perpetually engage in His transcendental loving service." Uttering this, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata left his body.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The entire Vedas are meant for the understanding of karma, jñ&#257;na and yoga &#8212; fruitive activity, speculative knowledge and mystic yoga. Whatever way of spiritual realization we accept, the ultimate goal is N&#257;r&#257;yana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entities are eternally connected with Him via devotional service. As stated in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, ante n&#257;r&#257;yana-smritih: the perfection of life is to remember N&#257;r&#257;yana at the time of death. Although Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had to accept the body of a deer, he could remember N&#257;r&#257;yana at the time of death. Consequently he took birth as a perfect devotee in a br&#257;hmana family. This confirms the statement of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/6/41.htm">6.41</A>), &#347;uc&#299;n&#257;m &#347;r&#299;mat&#257;m gehe yoga-bhrashto 'bhij&#257;yate: "One who falls from the path of self-realization takes birth in a family of br&#257;hmanas or wealthy aristocrats." Although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata appeared in the royal family, he became neglectful and took birth as a deer. Because he was very cautious within his deer body, he took birth in a br&#257;hmana family as Jada Bharata. During this lifetime, he remained perfectly Krishna conscious and preached the gospel of Krishna consciousness directly, beginning with his instructions to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;gana. In this regard, the word yog&#257;ya is very significant. The purpose of asht&#257;&#324;ga-yoga, as stated by Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, is to link or connect with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The goal is not to display some material perfections.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
