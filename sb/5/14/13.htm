He then loses all intelligence in their association. This is exactly like jumping in a shallow river. As a result one simply breaks his head. He is not able to mitigate his sufferings from the heat, and in both ways he suffers. The misguided conditioned soul also approaches so-called s&#257;dhus and sv&#257;m&#299;s who preach against the principles of the Vedas. He does not receive benefit from them, either in the present or in the future.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Cheaters are always there to manufacture their own way of spiritual realization. To get some material benefit, the conditioned soul approaches these pseudo sanny&#257;s&#299;s and yog&#299;s for cheap blessings, but he does not receive any benefit from them, either spiritual or material. In this age there are many cheaters who show some jugglery and magic. They even create gold to amaze their followers, and their followers accept them as God. This type of cheating is very prominent in Kali-yuga. Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura describes the real guru in this way.</P><P>sams&#257;ra-d&#257;v&#257;nala-l&#299;dha-loka-</P><P CLASS=n>tr&#257;n&#257;ya k&#257;runya-ghan&#257;ghanatvam</P><P CLASS=n>pr&#257;ptasya kaly&#257;na-gun&#257;rnavasya</P><P CLASS=n>vande guroh &#347;r&#299;-caran&#257;ravindam **</P><P>One should approach a guru who can extinguish the blazing fire of this material world, the struggle for existence. people want to be cheated. and therefore they go to yog&#299;s and sv&#257;m&#299;s who play tricks, but tricks do not mitigate the miseries of material life. If being able to manufacture gold is a criterion for becoming God, then why not accept Krishna, the proprietor of the entire universe, wherein there are countless tons of gold? As mentioned before, the color of gold is compared to the will-O'-the-wisp or yellow stool; therefore one should not be allured by gold-manufacturing gurus but should sincerely approach a devotee like Jada Bharata. Jada Bharata instructed Rah&#363;gana Mah&#257;r&#257;ja so well that the King was relieved from the bodily conception. One cannot become happy by accepting a false guru. A guru should be accepted as advised in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../11/3/21.htm">11.3.21</A>). Tasm&#257;d gurum prapadyeta jijñ&#257;suh &#347;reya uttamam: One should approach a bona fide guru to inquire about the highest benefit of life. Such a guru is described as follows: &#347;&#257;bde pare ca nishn&#257;tam. Such a guru does not manufacture gold or juggle words. He is well versed in the conclusions of Vedic knowledge (vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedyah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">Bg. 15.15</A>]). He is freed from all material contamination and is fully engaged in Krishna's service. If one is able to obtain the dust of the lotus feet of such a guru, his life becomes successful. Otherwise he is baffled both in this life and in the next.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
