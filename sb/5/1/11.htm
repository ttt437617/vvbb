Do not be jealous of the Supreme Lord, who is beyond our experimental measurements. All of us, including Lord &#346;iva, your father and the great sage Mah&#257;rshi N&#257;rada, must carry out the order of the Supreme. We cannot deviate from His order.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Of the twelve great authorities in devotional service, four &#8212; Lord Brahm&#257; himself, his son N&#257;rada, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu and Lord &#346;iva &#8212; were present before Priyavrata. They were accompanied by many other authoritative sages. Brahm&#257; first wanted to impress upon Priyavrata that although these great personalities are all authorities, they cannot possibly disobey the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described in this verse as deva, which means "always glorious." The power, glory and potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can never be diminished. In the &#298;&#347;opanishad, the Lord is described as ap&#257;pa-viddha, which indicates that He is never affected by anything materially considered sinful. Similarly, &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam describes the Supreme Personality of Godhead as being so powerful that nothing we might consider abominable can affect Him. An example sometimes given to explain the position of the Supreme Lord is that of the sun, which evaporates urine from the earth but is never affected by contamination. The Supreme Lord can never be accused of doing anything wrong.</P><P>When Lord Brahm&#257; went to induce Priyavrata to accept the responsibility for ruling the universe, he did not go whimsically; he was following the dictations of the Supreme Lord. Indeed, Brahm&#257; and other genuine authorities never do anything without His permission. The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart. In the beginning of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam it is said, tene brahma hrid&#257; ya &#257;di-kavaye: the Lord dictated Vedic knowledge to Brahm&#257; through his heart. The more a living entity is purified by devotional service, the more he comes in direct contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in &#346;r&#299;mad Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</P><P>tesh&#257;m satata-yukt&#257;n&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>bhajat&#257;m pr&#299;ti-p&#363;rvakam</P><P CLASS=n>dad&#257;mi buddhi-yogam tam</P><P CLASS=n>yena m&#257;m upay&#257;nti te</P><P>"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/10.htm">Bg. 10.10</A>) Lord Brahm&#257;, therefore, had not come to Priyavrata by his own whims: rather, it is understood that he had been ordered to persuade Priyavrata by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose activities cannot be understood by material senses and who is therefore described herein as aprameya. Thus Lord Brahm&#257; first advised Priyavrata to hear his words with attention and without envy.</P><P>Why one is induced to perform certain acts despite his desire to do something else is indicated herein. One cannot disobey the orders of the Supreme Lord, even if one is as powerful as Lord &#346;iva. Lord Brahm&#257;. Manu or the great sage N&#257;rada. All these authorities are certainly very powerful, but they do not have the power to disobey the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since Lord Brahm&#257; had come to Priyavrata in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Lord, he first wanted to dispel any suspicions that he might be acting as Priyavrata's enemy. Lord Brahm&#257; was following the orders of the Supreme Lord, and therefore it would be worthwhile for Priyavrata to accept Lord Brahm&#257;'s order, as the Lord desired.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
