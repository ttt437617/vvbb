Thus conquer the six sense organs [the mind and knowledge-acquiring senses]. Accept material enjoyment because the Lord, extraordinarily, has ordered you to do this. You will thus always be liberated from material association and be able to carry out the Lord's orders in your constitutional position.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>There are three kinds of men within this material world. Those who are trying to enjoy the senses to the utmost are called karm&#299;s, above them are the jñ&#257;n&#299;s, who try to conquer the urges of the senses, and above them are the yog&#299;s, who have already conquered the senses. None of them, however, are situated in a transcendental position. Only devotees. who belong to none of the above-mentioned groups, are transcendental. As explained in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/14/26.htm">14.26</A>):</P><P>m&#257;m ca yo 'vyabhic&#257;rena</P><P CLASS=n>bhakti-yogena sevate</P><P CLASS=n>sa gun&#257;n samat&#299;tyait&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>brahma-bh&#363;y&#257;ya kalpate</P><P>"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." Lord Brahm&#257; herein advises Priyavrata to remain transcendental in the fortress not of family life but of the lotus feet of the Lord (abja-n&#257;bh&#257;&#324;ghri-saroja). When a bumblebee enters the opening of a lotus flower and drinks its honey, it is fully protected by the petals of the lotus. The bee is undisturbed by sunshine and other external influences. Similarly, one who always seeks shelter at the lotus feet of the personality of Godhead is protected from all dangers. It is therefore said in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../10/14/58.htm">10.14.58</A>):</P><P>sam&#257;&#347;rit&#257; ye pada-pallava-plavam</P><P CLASS=n>mahat-padam punya-ya&#347;o mur&#257;reh</P><P CLASS=n>bhav&#257;mbudhir vatsa-padam param padam</P><P CLASS=n>padam padam yad vipad&#257;m na tesh&#257;m</P><P>For one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, everything becomes easier. Indeed, even crossing the great ocean of nescience (bhav&#257;mbudhi) is exactly like crossing the hoofprint created by a calf (vatsa-padam). For such a devotee, there is no question of remaining in a place where every step is dangerous.</P><P>Our actual duty is to carry out the supreme order of the Personality of Godhead. If we are fixed in our determination to carry out the supreme order of the Lord, we are always secure, regardless of where we are situated, whether in hell or in heaven. Herein the words prakritim bhajasva are very significant. Prakritim refers to one's constitutional position. Every living entity has the constitutional position of being an eternal servant of God. Therefore Lord Brahm&#257; advised Priyavrata, "Be situated in your original position as an eternal servant of the Lord. If you carry out His orders, you will never fall, even in the midst of material enjoyment." Material enjoyment achieved by dint of one's fruitive activities differs from material enjoyment given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee sometimes appears to be in a very opulent position, but he accepts that position to follow the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore a devotee is never affected by material influences. The devotees in the Krishna consciousness movement are preaching all over the world in accordance with the order of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. They have to meet many karm&#299;s, but by the mercy of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, they are unaffected by material influences. He has blessed them, as described in the Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/7/129.htm">Madhya 7.129</A>):</P><P>kabhu n&#257; b&#257;dhibe tom&#257;ra vishaya-tara&#324;ga</P><P CLASS=n>punarapi ei th&#257;ñi p&#257;be mora sa&#324;ge</P><P>A sincere devotee who engages in the service of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu by preaching His cult all over the world will never be affected by vishaya-tara&#324;ga, material influences. On the contrary, in due course of time he will return to the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and will thus have perpetual association with Him.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
