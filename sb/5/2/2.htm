He went to a valley of Mandara Hill, where the damsels of the heavenly planets come down to stroll. There he collected garden flowers and other necessary paraphernalia and then engaged in severe austerities and worship.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The King became pitriloka-k&#257;ma, or desirous of being transferred to the planet named Pitriloka. Pitriloka is mentioned in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n pitrin y&#257;nti pitri-vrat&#257;h [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/25.htm">Bg. 9.25</A>]). To go to this planet, one needs very good sons who can make offerings to Lord Vishnu and then offer the remnants to their forefathers. The purpose of the &#347;r&#257;ddha ceremony is to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vishnu, so that after pleasing Him one may offer pras&#257;da to one's forefathers and in this way make them happy. The inhabitants of Pitriloka are generally men of the karma-k&#257;nd&#299;ya, or fruitive activities category, who have been transferred there because of their pious activities. They can stay there as long as their descendants offer them vishnu-pras&#257;da. Everyone in heavenly planets such as Pitriloka, however, must return to earth after exhausting the effects of his pious acts. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/21.htm">9.21</A>), ksh&#299;ne punye martya-lokam vi&#347;anti: persons who perform pious acts are transferred to higher planets, but when the effects of their pious acts are over, they are again transferred to earth.</P><P>Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was a great devotee, how could he have begotten a son who desired to be transferred to Pitriloka? Lord Krishna says, pitrin y&#257;nti pitri-vrat&#257;h: persons who desire to go to Pitriloka are transferred there. Similarly, y&#257;nti mad-y&#257;jino 'pi m&#257;m: persons who desire to be transferred to the spiritual planets, Vaikunthalokas, can also go there. Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra was the son of a Vaishnava, he should have desired to be transferred to the spiritual world, Vaikunthaloka. Why, then, did he desire to be transferred to Pitriloka? In answer to this, Gosv&#257;m&#299; Giridhara, one of the Bh&#257;gavatam commentators, remarks that &#256;gn&#299;dhra was born when Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was infatuated by lusty desires. This may be accepted as a fact because sons are begotten with different mentalities according to the time of their conception. According to the Vedic system, therefore, before a child is conceived, the garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-samsk&#257;ra is performed. This ceremony molds the mentality of the father in such a way that when he plants his seed in the womb of his wife, he will beget a child whose mind will be completely saturated with a devotional attitude. At the present moment, however, there are no such garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-samsk&#257;ras, and therefore people generally have a lusty attitude when they beget children. Especially in this age of Kali, there are no garbh&#257;dh&#257;na ceremonies; everyone enjoys sex with his wife like a cat or dog. Therefore according to &#347;&#257;stric injunctions, almost all the people of this age belong to the &#347;&#363;dra category. Of course, although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra had a desire to be transferred to Pitriloka, this does not mean that his mentality was that of a &#347;&#363;dra; he was a kshatriya.</P><P>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra desired to be transferred to Pitriloka, and therefore he needed a wife because anyone desiring to be transferred to Pitriloka must leave behind a good son to offer yearly pinda, or pras&#257;da from Lord Vishnu. To have a good son, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra wanted a wife from a family of demigods. Therefore he went to Mandara Hill. where the women of the demigods generally come, to worship Lord Brahm&#257;. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/12.htm">4.12</A>) it is said, k&#257;&#324;kshantah karman&#257;m siddhim yajanta iha devat&#257;h: materialists who want quick results in the material world worship demigods. This is also confirmed in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam. &#346;r&#299;-ai&#347;varya-prajepsavah: those who desire beautiful wives, substantial wealth and many sons worship the demigods, but an intelligent devotee, instead of being entangled by the happiness of this material world in the form of a beautiful wife, material opulence and children, desires to be immediately transferred back home, back to Godhead. Thus he worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
