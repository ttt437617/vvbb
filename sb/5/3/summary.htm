Wanting to have sons, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi underwent severe austerities and penances. He performed many sacrifices along with his wife and worshiped Lord Vishnu, master of all sacrifices. Being very kind to His devotees, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was very pleased with the austerities of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi. He personally appeared before the King in His four-handed feature, and the priests, who were performing the sacrifices, began to offer their prayers unto Him. They prayed for a son like the Lord, and Lord Vishnu agreed to take birth in the womb of Merudev&#299;, the wife of King N&#257;bhi, and incarnate as King Rishabhadeva.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../2/23.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
