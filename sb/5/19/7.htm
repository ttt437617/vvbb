None of these qualifications is actually a prerequisite for friendship with Lord &#346;r&#299; R&#257;macandra. Otherwise how is it possible that although we uncivilized inhabitants of the forest have not taken noble births, although we have no physical beauty and although we cannot speak like gentlemen, Lord R&#257;macandra has nevertheless accepted us as friends?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In a prayer to Krishna expressing her feelings, &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Kunt&#299;dev&#299; called Him akiñcana-gocara. The prefix a means "not," and kiñcana "something of this material world." One may be very proud of his prestigious position, material wealth, beauty, education and so on, but although these are certainly good qualifications in material dealings, they are not necessary for achieving friendship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who possesses all these material qualities is expected to become a devotee, and when he actually does, the qualities are properly utilized. Those who are puffed up by a high birth, wealth, education and personal beauty (janmai&#347;varya-&#347;ruta-&#347;r&#299;) unfortunately do not care for developing Krishna consciousness, nor does the Supreme Personality of Godhead care about all these material qualifications. The Supreme Lord is achieved by devotion (bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/55.htm">Bg. 18.55</A>]). One's devotion and sincere desire to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead are the only qualifications. R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has also said that the price for achieving God's favor is simply one's sincere eagerness to have it (laulyam ekam m&#363;lyam). In the Caitanya-bh&#257;gavata it is said:</P><P>khol&#257;vec&#257; sevakera dekha bh&#257;gya-s&#299;m&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>brahm&#257; &#347;iva k&#257;&#324;de y&#257;ra dekhiy&#257; mahim&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>dhane jane p&#257;nditye krishna n&#257;hi p&#257;i</P><P CLASS=n>kevala bhaktira va&#347;a caitanya-gos&#257;ñi</P><P>"Behold the great fortune of the devotee Khol&#257;vec&#257;. Lord Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva shed tears upon seeing his greatness. One cannot attain Lord Krishna by any amount of wealth, followers, or learning. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is controlled only by pure devotion. "Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu had a very sincere devotee whose name was Khol&#257;vec&#257; &#346;r&#299;dhara and whose only business was to sell pots made of the skin of banana trees. Whatever income he had, he used fifty percent for the worship of mother Ganges, and with the other fifty percent he provided for his necessities. On the whole, he was so very poor that he lived in a cottage that had a broken roof with many holes in it. He could not afford brass utensils, and therefore he drank water from an iron pot. Nevertheless, he was a great devotee of Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. He is a typical example of how a poor man with no material possessions can become a most exalted devotee of the Lord. The conclusion is that one cannot attain shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna or &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Gos&#257;ñi through material opulence; that shelter is attainable only by pure devotional service.</P><P>any&#257;bhil&#257;shit&#257;-&#347;&#363;nyam</P><P CLASS=n>jñ&#257;na-karm&#257;dy-an&#257;vritam</P><P CLASS=n>&#257;nuk&#363;lyena krishn&#257;nu-</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;&#299;lanam bhaktir uttam&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>[<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/19/167.htm">Madhya 19.167</A>]</P><P>"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krishna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation.
