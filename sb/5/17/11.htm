Learned scholars and saintly persons declare the other eight varshas to be meant for very highly elevated pious persons. After returning from the heavenly planets, they enjoy the remaining results of their pious activities in these eight earthly varshas.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The heavenly places of enjoyment are divided into three groups: the celestial heavenly planets, the heavenly places on earth, and the bila heavenly places, which are found in the lower regions. Among these three classes of heavenly places (bhauma-svarga-pada-ni), the heavenly places on earth are the eight varshas other than Bh&#257;rata-varsha. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/21.htm">9.21</A>) Krishna says, ksh&#299;ne punye martya-lokam vi&#347;anti: when the persons living in the heavenly planets exhaust the results of their pious activities, they return to this earth. In this way, they are elevated to the heavenly planets, and then they again fall to the earthly planets. This process is known as brahm&#257;nda bhramana, wandering up and down throughout the universes. Those who are intelligent &#8212; in other words, those who have not lost their intelligence &#8212; do not involve themselves in this process of wandering up and down. They take to the devotional service of the Lord so that they can ultimately penetrate the covering of this universe and enter the spiritual kingdom. Then they are situated on one of the planets known as Vaikunthaloka or, still higher. Krishnaloka (Goloka Vrind&#257;vana). A devotee is never caught in the process of being promoted to the heavenly planets and again coming down. Therefore &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu says:</P><P>ei r&#363;pe brahm&#257;nda bhramite kona bh&#257;gyav&#257;n j&#299;va</P><P CLASS=n>guru-krishna-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja</P><P CLASS=n>[Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/19/151.htm">Madhya 19.151</A>]</P><P>Among all the living entities wandering throughout the universe, one who is most fortunate comes in contact with a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus gets the opportunity to execute devotional service. Those who are sincerely seeking the favor of Krishna come in contact with a guru, a bona fide representative of Krishna. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s indulging in mental speculation and the karm&#299;s desiring the results of their actions cannot become gurus. A guru must be a direct representative of Krishna who distributes the instructions of Krishna without any change. Thus only the most fortunate persons come in contact with the guru. As confirmed in the Vedic literatures, tad-vijñ&#257;n&#257;rtham sa gurum ev&#257;bhigacchet: [<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/mu1/2/12">MU 1.2.12</A>] one has to search out a guru to understand the affairs of the spiritual world. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam also confirms this point. Tasm&#257;d gurum prapadyeta jijñ&#257;suh &#347;reya uttamam: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../11/3/21.htm">SB 11.3.21</A>] one who is very interested in understanding the activities in the spiritual world must search out a guru &#8212; a bona fide representative of Krishna. From all angles of vision, therefore, the word guru is especially meant for the bona fide representative of Krishna and no one else. Padma Pur&#257;na states, avaishnavo gurur na sy&#257;t: one who is not a Vaishnava, or who is not a representative of Krishna, cannot be a guru. Even the most qualified br&#257;hmana cannot become a guru if he is not a representative of Krishna. Br&#257;hmanas are supposed to acquire six kinds of auspicious qualifications: they become very learned scholars (pathana) and very qualified teachers (p&#257;thana); they become expert in worshiping the Lord or the demigods (yajana), and they teach others how to execute this worship (y&#257;jana); they qualify themselves as bona fide persons to receive alms from others (pratigraha), and they distribute the wealth in charity (d&#257;na). Yet even a br&#257;hmana possessing these qualifications cannot become a guru unless he is the representative of Krishna (gurur na sy&#257;t). Vaishnavah &#347;va-paco guruh: but a Vaishnava, a bona fide representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu, can become a guru, even if he is &#347;va-paca, a member of a family of dog-eaters. Of the three divisions of heavenly planets (svarga-loka), bhauma-svarga is sometimes accepted as the tract of land in Bh&#257;rata-varsha known as Kashmir. In this region there are certainly good facilities for material sense enjoyment, but this is not the business of a pure transcendentalist. R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes the engagement of a pure transcendentalist as follows:</P><P>any&#257;bhil&#257;shit&#257;-&#347;&#363;nyam</P><P CLASS=n>jñ&#257;na-karm&#257;dy-an&#257;vritam</P><P CLASS=n>&#257;nuk&#363;lyena krishn&#257;nu-</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;&#299;lanam bhaktir uttam&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>[<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/19/167.htm">Madhya 19.167</A>]</P><P>"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krishna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service." Those who fully engage in devotional service to Krishna just to please Him are not interested in the three divisions of heavenly places, namely, divya-svarga, bhauma-svarga and bila-svarga.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
