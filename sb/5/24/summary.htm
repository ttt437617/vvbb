R&#257;hu is situated below the sun and moon. It is between these two planets and the earth. When R&#257;hu conceals the sun and moon, eclipses occur, either total or partial, depending on whether R&#257;hu moves in a straight or curving way.</P><P>Below R&#257;hu by another 1,000,000 yojanas are the planets of the Siddhas, C&#257;ranas and Vidy&#257;dharas, and below these are planets such as Yakshaloka and Rakshaloka. Below these planets is the earth, and 70,000 yojanas below the earth are the lower planetary systems &#8212; Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Tal&#257;tala, Mah&#257;tala, Ras&#257;tala and P&#257;t&#257;la. Demons and Rakshasas live in these lower planetary systems with their wives and children, always engaged in sense gratification and not fearing their next births. The sunshine does not reach these planets, but they are illuminated by jewels fixed upon the hoods of snakes. Because of these shining gems there is practically no darkness. Those living in these planets do not become old or diseased, and they are not afraid of death from any cause but the time factor, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P>In the planet Atala, the yawning of a demon has produced three kinds of women, called svairin&#299; (independent), k&#257;min&#299; (lusty) and pum&#347;cal&#299; (very easily subdued by men). Below Atala is the planet Vitala, wherein Lord &#346;iva and his wife Gaur&#299; reside. Because of their presence, a kind of gold is produced called h&#257;taka. Below Vitala is the planet Sutala, the abode of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the most fortunate king. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V&#257;manadeva, because of his intense devotional service. The Lord went to the sacrificial arena of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and begged him for three paces of land, and on this plea the Lord took from him all his possessions. When Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja agreed to all this, the Lord was very pleased, and therefore the Lord serves as his doorkeeper. The description of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja appears in the Eighth Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</P><P>When the Supreme Personality of Godhead offers a devotee material happiness, this is not His real favor. The demigods, who are very puffed up by their material opulence, pray to the Lord only for material happiness, not knowing anything better. Devotees like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, however, do not want material happiness. Not to speak of material happiness, they do not want even liberation from material bondage, although one can achieve this liberation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, even with improper pronunciation.</P><P>Below Sutala is the planet Tal&#257;tala, the abode of the demon Maya. This demon is always materially happy because he is favored by Lord &#346;iva, but he cannot achieve spiritual happiness at any time. Below Tal&#257;tala is the planet Mah&#257;tala, where there are many snakes with hundreds and thousands of hoods. Below Mah&#257;tala is Ras&#257;tala, and below that is P&#257;t&#257;la, where the serpent Vasuk&#299; lives with his associates.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../23/9.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
