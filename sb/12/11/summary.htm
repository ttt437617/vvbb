Then he outlines the process of practical service by which a mortal soul can attain immortality. When &#346;aunaka shows further interest in learning about the expansion of Lord Hari in the form of the sungod, S&#363;ta replies that Lord &#346;r&#299; Hari &#8212; the indwelling controller of the universe and its original creator &#8212; manifests Himself in the form of the demigod of the sun. Sages describe this sun-god in many features according to his different material designations. To sustain the world, the Personality of Godhead manifests His potency of time as the sun and travels throughout the twelve months, beginning with Caitra, along with twelve sets of personal associates. One who remembers the opulences of the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; Hari in His form as the sun will become free of his sinful reactions.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../10/42.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
