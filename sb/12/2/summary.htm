After that, a new Satya-yuga will begin.</P><P>As the age of Kali progresses, all good qualities of men diminish and all impure qualities increase. Atheistic systems of so-called religion become predominant, replacing the codes of Vedic law. The kings become just like highway bandits, the people in general become dedicated to low occupations, and all the social classes become just like &#347;&#363;dras. All cows become like goats, all spiritual hermitages become like materialistic homes, and family ties extend no further than the immediate relationship of marriage.</P><P>When the age of Kali has almost ended, the Supreme Personality of Godhead will incarnate. He will appear in the village &#346;ambhala, in the home of the exalted br&#257;hmana Vishnuya&#347;&#257;, and will take the name Kalki. He will mount His horse Devadatta and, taking His sword in hand, will roam about the earth killing millions of bandits in the guise of kings. Then the signs of the next Satya-yuga will begin to appear. When the moon, sun and the planet Brihaspati enter simultaneously into one constellation and conjoin in the lunar mansion Pushy&#257;, Satya-yuga will begin. In the order of Satya, Tret&#257;, Dv&#257;para and Kali, the cycle of four ages rotates in the society of living entities in this universe.</P><P>The chapter ends with a brief description of the future dynasties of the sun and moon coming from Vaivasvata Manu in the next Satya-yuga. Even now two saintly kshatriyas are living who at the end of this Kali-yuga will reinitiate the pious dynasties of the sun-god, Vivasv&#257;n, and the moon-god, Candra. One of these kings is Dev&#257;pi, a brother of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;antanu, and the other is Maru, a descendant of Ikshv&#257;ku. They are biding their time incognito in a village named Kal&#257;pa.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../1/41.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
