May you all be protected by the winds caused by the Lord's breathing in this sleepy condition. Ever since that time, even up to the present day, the ocean tides have imitated the Lord's inhalation and exhalation by piously coming in and going out.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>SB 12.13.3</B></A>: Now please hear a summation of the verse length of each of the Pur&#257;nas. Then hear of the prime subject and purpose of this Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;na, the proper method of giving it as a gift, the glories of such gift-giving, and finally the glories of hearing and chanting this literature.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4-9.htm"><B>SB 12.13.4-9</B></A>: The Brahm&#257; Pur&#257;na consists of ten thousand verses, the Padma Pur&#257;na of fifty-five thousand, &#346;r&#299; Vishnu Pur&#257;na of twenty-three thousand, the &#346;iva Pur&#257;na of twenty-four thousand and &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam of eighteen thousand. The N&#257;rada Pur&#257;na has twenty-five thousand verses, the M&#257;rkandeya Pur&#257;na nine thousand, the Agni Pur&#257;na fifteen thousand four hundred, the Bhavishya Pur&#257;na fourteen thousand five hundred, the Brahma-vaivarta Pur&#257;na eighteen thousand and the Li&#324;ga Pur&#257;na eleven thousand. The Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;na contains twenty-four thousand verses, the Skanda Pur&#257;na eighty-one thousand one hundred, the V&#257;mana Pur&#257;na ten thousand, the K&#363;rma Pur&#257;na seventeen thousand, the Matsya Pur&#257;na fourteen thousand, the Garuda Pur&#257;na nineteen thousand and the Brahm&#257;nda Pur&#257;na twelve thousand. Thus the total number of verses in all the Pur&#257;nas is four hundred thousand. Eighteen thousand of these, once again, belong to the beautiful Bh&#257;gavatam.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 12.13.10</B></A>: It was to Lord Brahm&#257; that the Supreme Personality of Godhead first revealed the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam in full. At the time, Brahm&#257;, frightened by material existence, was sitting on the lotus flower that had grown from the Lord's navel.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11-12.htm"><B>SB 12.13.11-12</B></A>: From beginning to end, the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is full of narrations that encourage renunciation of material life, as well as nectarean accounts of Lord Hari's transcendental pastimes, which give ecstasy to the saintly devotees and demigods. This Bh&#257;gavatam is the essence of all Ved&#257;nta philosophy because its subject matter is the Absolute Truth, which, while nondifferent from the spirit soul, is the ultimate reality, one without a second. The goal of this literature is exclusive devotional service unto that Supreme Truth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 12.13.13</B></A>: If on the full moon day of the month of Bh&#257;dra one places &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam on a golden throne and gives it as a gift, he will attain the supreme transcendental destination.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 12.13.14</B></A>: All other Puranic scriptures shine forth in the assembly of saintly devotees only as long as that great ocean of nectar, &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, is not heard.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 12.13.15</B></A>: &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is declared to be the essence of all Ved&#257;nta philosophy. One who has felt satisfaction from its nectarean mellow will never be attracted to any other literature.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 12.13.16</B></A>: Just as the Ga&#324;g&#257; is the greatest of all rivers, Lord Acyuta the supreme among deities and Lord &#346;ambhu [&#346;iva] the greatest of Vaishnavas, so &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is the greatest of all Pur&#257;nas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 12.13.17</B></A>: O br&#257;hmanas, in the same way that the city of K&#257;&#347;&#299; is unexcelled among holy places, &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is supreme among all the Pur&#257;nas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 12.13.18</B></A>: &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is the spotless Pur&#257;na. It is most dear to the Vaishnavas because it describes the pure and supreme knowledge of the paramahamsas. This Bh&#257;gavatam reveals the means for becoming free from all material work, together with the processes of transcendental knowledge, renunciation and devotion. Anyone who seriously tries to understand &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, who properly hears and chants it with devotion, becomes completely liberated.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 12.13.19</B></A>: I meditate upon that pure and spotless Supreme Absolute Truth, who is free from suffering and death and who in the beginning personally revealed this incomparable torchlight of knowledge to Brahm&#257;. Brahm&#257; then spoke it to the sage N&#257;rada, who narrated it to Krishna-dvaip&#257;yana Vy&#257;sa. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sa revealed this Bh&#257;gavatam to the greatest of sages, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and &#346;ukadeva mercifully spoke it to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 12.13.20</B></A>: We offer our obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord V&#257;sudeva, the all-pervading witness, who mercifully explained this science to Brahm&#257; when he anxiously desired salvation.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>SB 12.13.21</B></A>: I offer my humble obeisances to &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the best of mystic sages and a personal manifestation of the Absolute Truth. He saved Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit, who was bitten by the snake of material existence.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>SB 12.13.22</B></A>: O Lord of lords, O master, please grant us pure devotional service at Your lotus feet, life after life.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>SB 12.13.23</B></A>: I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, Hari, the congregational chanting of whose holy names destroys all sinful reactions, and the offering of obeisances unto whom relieves all material suffering.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
