This is very much to be appreciated as the standard behavior of a Vaishnava.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Upon being informed by Lord &#346;iva, mother P&#257;rvat&#299; could understand that she was wrong in cursing Citraketu. King Citraketu was so exalted in his character that in spite of being wrongly cursed by P&#257;rvat&#299;, he immediately descended from his airplane and bowed his head before the mother, accepting her curse. This has already been explained: n&#257;r&#257;yana-par&#257;h sarve na kuta&#347;cana bibhyati. Citraketu very sportingly felt that since the mother wanted to curse him, he could accept this curse just to please her. This is called s&#257;dhu-lakshanam, the characteristic of a s&#257;dhu, or a devotee. As explained by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, trin&#257;d api sun&#299;cena taror api sahishnun&#257;. A devotee should always be very humble and meek and should offer all respect to others, especially to superiors. Being protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee is always powerful, but a devotee does not wish to show his power unnecessarily. However, when a less intelligent person has some power, he wants to use it for sense gratification. This is not the behavior of a devotee.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
