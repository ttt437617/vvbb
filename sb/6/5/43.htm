Therefore you are a rascal who does not know how to behave toward others. You may travel all over the universe, but I curse you to have no residence anywhere.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Because Praj&#257;pati Daksha was a grihamedh&#299; who wanted to remain in household life, he thought that if N&#257;rada Muni could not remain in one place, but had to travel all over the world, that would be a great punishment for him. Actually, however, such a punishment is a boon for a preacher. A preacher is known as parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya &#8212; an &#257;c&#257;rya, or teacher, who always travels for the benefit of human society. Praj&#257;pati Daksha cursed N&#257;rada Muni by saying that although he had the facility to travel all over the universe, he would never be able to stay in one place. In the parampar&#257; system from N&#257;rada Muni, I have also been cursed. Although I have many centers that would be suitable places of residence, I cannot stay anywhere, for I have been cursed by the parents of my young disciples. Since the Krishna consciousness movement was started, I have traveled all over the world two or three times a year, and although I am provided comfortable places to stay wherever I go, I cannot stay anywhere for more than three days or a week. I do not mind this curse by the parents of my disciples, but now it is necessary that I stay in one place to finish another task &#8212; this translation of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam. If my young disciples, especially those who have taken sanny&#257;sa, take charge of traveling all over the world, it may be possible for me to transfer the curse of the parents to these young preachers. Then I may sit down conveniently in one place for the work of translation.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
