You needlessly created a mentality of renunciation in innocent boys, and therefore you are shameless and devoid of compassion. How could you travel with the personal associates of the Supreme Lord ?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>This mentality of Praj&#257;pati Daksha still continues even today. When young boys join the Krishna consciousness movement, their fathers and so-called guardians are very angry at the propounder of the Krishna consciousness movement because they think that their sons have been unnecessarily induced to deprive themselves of the material enjoyments of eating, drinking and merrymaking. Karm&#299;s, fruitive workers, think that one should fully enjoy his present life in this material world and also perform some pious activities to be promoted to higher planetary systems for further enjoyment in the next life. A yog&#299;, however, especially a bhakti-yog&#299;, is callous to the opinions of this material world. He is not interested in traveling to the higher planetary systems of the demigods to enjoy a long life in an advanced materialistic civilization. As stated by Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299;, kaivalyam narak&#257;yate trida&#347;a-p&#363;r &#257;k&#257;&#347;a-pushp&#257;yate: for a devotee, merging into the Brahman existence is hellish, and life in the higher planetary systems of the demigods is a will-o'-the-wisp, a phantasmagoria with no real existence at all. A pure devotee is not interested in yogic perfection, travel to higher planetary systems, or oneness with Brahman. He is interested only in rendering service to the Personality of Godhead. Since Praj&#257;pati Daksha was a karm&#299;, he could not appreciate the great service N&#257;rada Muni had rendered his eleven thousand sons. Instead, he accused N&#257;rada Muni of being sinful and charged that because N&#257;rada Muni was associated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord would also be defamed. Thus Daksha criticized that N&#257;rada Muni was an offender to the Lord although he was known as an associate of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
