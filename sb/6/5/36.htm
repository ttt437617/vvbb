Indeed, although I am now in grihastha life, I am a saintly person. By showing my sons the path of renunciation, you have done me an abominable injustice.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu said, sanny&#257;s&#299;ra alpa chidra sarva-loke g&#257;ya (Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/12/51.htm">Madhya 12.51</A>). In society one will find many sanny&#257;s&#299;s, v&#257;naprasthas, grihasthas and brahmac&#257;r&#299;s, but if all of them properly live in accordance with their duties, they are understood to be s&#257;dhus. Praj&#257;pati Daksha was certainly a s&#257;dhu because he had executed such great austerities that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vishnu, had appeared before him. Nevertheless, he had a fault-finding mentality. He improperly thought N&#257;rada Muni to be as&#257;dhu, or nonsaintly, because N&#257;rada had foiled his intentions. Desiring to train his sons to become grihasthas fully equipped with knowledge, Daksha had sent them to execute austerities by N&#257;r&#257;yana-saras. N&#257;rada Muni, however, taking advantage of their highly elevated position in austerity, instructed them to become Vaishnavas in the renounced order. This is the duty of N&#257;rada Muni and his followers. They must show everyone the path of renouncing this material world and returning home, back to Godhead. Praj&#257;pati Daksha, however, could not see the exaltedness of the duties N&#257;rada Muni performed in relation to his sons. Unable to appreciate N&#257;rada Muni's behavior, Daksha accused N&#257;rada of being as&#257;dhu.</P><P>The words bhikshor m&#257;rga, "the path of the renounced order," are very significant in this regard. A sanny&#257;s&#299; is called tridandi-bhikshu because his duty is to beg alms from the homes of grihasthas and to give the grihasthas spiritual instructions. A sanny&#257;s&#299; is allowed to beg from door to door, but a grihastha cannot do so. Grihasthas may earn their living according to the four divisions of spiritual life. A br&#257;hmana grihastha may earn his livelihood by becoming a learned scholar and teaching people in general how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He may also assume the duty of worship himself. Therefore it is said that only br&#257;hmanas may engage in Deity worship, and they may accept as pras&#257;da whatever people offer the Deity. Although a br&#257;hmana may sometimes accept charity, it is not for his personal maintenance but for the worship of the Deity. Thus a br&#257;hmana does not stock anything for his future use. Similarly, kshatriyas may collect taxes from the citizens, and they must also protect the citizens, enforce rules and regulations, and maintain law and order. Vai&#347;yas should earn their livelihood through agriculture and cow protection, and &#347;&#363;dras should maintain their livelihood by serving the three higher classes. Unless one becomes a br&#257;hmana, one cannot take sanny&#257;sa. Sanny&#257;s&#299;s and brahmac&#257;r&#299;s may beg alms door to door, but a grihastha cannot.</P><P>Praj&#257;pati Daksha condemned N&#257;rada Muni because N&#257;rada, a brahmac&#257;r&#299; who could beg from door to door, had made sanny&#257;s&#299;s of Daksha's sons, who were being trained to be grihasthas. Daksha was extremely angry at N&#257;rada because he thought that N&#257;rada had done him a great injustice. According to Daksha's opinion, N&#257;rada Muni had misled Daksha's inexperienced sons (as&#257;dhv ak&#257;ry arbhak&#257;n&#257;m). Daksha regarded his sons as innocent boys who had been misled when N&#257;rada showed them the renounced order of life. Because of all these considerations, Praj&#257;pati Daksha charged that N&#257;rada Muni was as&#257;dhu and should not have adopted the dress of a s&#257;dhu.</P><P>Sometimes a saintly person is misunderstood by grihasthas, especially when he instructs their young sons to accept Krishna consciousness. Generally a grihastha thinks that unless one enters grihastha life he cannot properly enter the renounced order. If a young man immediately adopts the path of the renounced order in accordance with the instructions of N&#257;rada or a member of his disciplic succession, his parents become very angry. This same phenomenon is occurring in our Krishna consciousness movement because we are instructing all the young boys in the Western countries to follow the path of renunciation. We allow grihastha life, but a grihastha also follows the path of renunciation. Even a grihastha has to give up so many bad habits that his parents think his life has been practically destroyed. We allow no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication, and consequently the parents wonder how, if there are so many no's, one's life can be positive. In the Western countries especially, these four prohibited activities practically constitute the life and soul of the modern population. Therefore parents sometimes dislike our movement, just as Praj&#257;pati Daksha disliked the activities of N&#257;rada and accused N&#257;rada of dishonesty. Nevertheless, although parents may be angry at us, we must perform our duty without hesitation because we are in the disciplic succession from N&#257;rada Muni.</P><P>People addicted to householder life wonder how one can give up the enjoyment of grihastha life, which is a concession for sex enjoyment, simply to become a mendicant in Krishna consciousness. They do not know that the householder's concession for sex life cannot be regulated unless one accepts the life of a mendicant. The Vedic civilization therefore enjoins that at the end of one's fiftieth year one must give up household life. This is compulsory. However, because modern civilization is misled, householders want to remain in family life until death, and therefore they are suffering. In such cases, the disciples of N&#257;rada Muni advise all the members of the younger generation to join the Krishna consciousness movement immediately. There is nothing wrong in this.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
