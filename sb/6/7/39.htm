By this intelligent mantra, he took away the opulence of the demons and gave it to Mahendra, the King of heaven.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The distinction between the demigods (devas) and demons (asuras) is that the demigods are all devotees of Lord Vishnu whereas the demons are devotees of demigods like Lord &#346;iva, Goddess K&#257;l&#299; and Goddess Durg&#257;. Sometimes the demons are also devotees of Lord Brahm&#257;. For example, Hiranyaka&#347;ipu was a devotee of Lord Brahm&#257;, R&#257;vana was a devotee of Lord &#346;iva, and Mahish&#257;sura was a devotee of Goddess Durg&#257;. The demigods are devotees of Lord Vishnu (vishnu-bhaktah smrito daiva), whereas the demons (&#257;suras tad-viparyayah) are always against the vishnu-bhaktas, or Vaishnavas. To oppose the Vaishnavas, the demons become devotees of Lord &#346;iva, Lord Brahm&#257;, K&#257;l&#299;, Durg&#257;, and so on. In the days of yore, many long years ago, there was animosity between the devas and the asuras, and the same spirit still continues, for the devotees of Lord &#346;iva and Goddess Durg&#257; are always envious of Vaishnavas, who are devotees of Lord Vishnu. This strain between the devotees of Lord &#346;iva and Lord Vishnu has always existed. In the higher planetary systems, fights between the demons and the demigods continue for a long, long time.</P><P>Herein we see that Vi&#347;var&#363;pa made for the demigods a protective covering, saturated with a Vishnu mantra. Sometimes the Vishnu mantra is called Vishnu-jvara, and the &#346;iva mantra is called &#346;iva-jvara. We find in the &#347;&#257;stras that sometimes the &#346;iva-jvara and Vishnu-jvara are employed in the fights between the demons and the demigods.</P><P>The word sura-dvish&#257;m, which in this verse means "of the enemies of the demigods," also refers to the atheists. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam elsewhere says that Lord Buddha appeared for the purpose of bewildering the demons or atheists. The Supreme Personality of Godhead always awards His benediction to devotees. The Lord Himself confirms this in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/31.htm">9.31</A>):</P><P>kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi</P><P CLASS=n>na me bhaktah prana&#347;yati</P><P>"O son of Kunt&#299;, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
