The demigods, however, encouraged Indra not to fear killing him because Indra was protected by the N&#257;r&#257;yana-kavaca, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana. Even by a glimpse of the chanting of N&#257;r&#257;yana's name, one becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing a woman, a cow or a br&#257;hmana. The demigods advised Indra to perform an a&#347;vamedha sacrifice, by which N&#257;r&#257;yana would be pleased, for the performer of such a sacrifice is not implicated in sinful reactions even if he kills the entire universe.</P><P>Following this instruction from the demigods, King Indra fought Vritr&#257;sura, but when Vritr&#257;sura was killed, everyone was satisfied but King Indra, who knew Vritr&#257;sura's position. This is the nature of a great personality. Even if a great personality acquires some opulence, he is always ashamed and regretful if he acquires it illegally. Indra could understand that he was certainly entangled by sinful reactions for killing a br&#257;hmana. Indeed, he could see sinful reaction personified following him, and thus he fled here and there in fear, thinking of how to rid himself of his sins. He went to M&#257;nasa-sarovara, and there, under the protection of the goddess of fortune, he meditated for one thousand years. During this time, Nahusha reigned over the heavenly planets as the representative of Indra. Unfortunately, however, he was attracted by the beauty of Indra's wife, &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;, and because of his sinful desire he had to accept the body of a serpent in his next life. Indra later performed a great sacrifice with the help of exalted br&#257;hmanas and saints. In this way he was released from the reactions of his sinful killing of a br&#257;hmana.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../12/35.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
