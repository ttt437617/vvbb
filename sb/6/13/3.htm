I wish to hear about this. When he killed Vritr&#257;sura, all the demigods were extremely happy. Why, then, was Indra himself unhappy?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>This, of course, is a very intelligent question. When a demon is killed, certainly all the demigods are happy. In this case, however, when all the demigods were happy because of Vritr&#257;sura's having been killed, Indra was unhappy. Why? It may be suggested that Indra was unhappy because he knew that he had killed a great devotee and br&#257;hmana. Vritr&#257;sura outwardly appeared to be a demon, but inwardly he was a great devotee and therefore a great br&#257;hmana.</P><P>Herein it is clearly indicated that a person who is not at all demoniac, such as Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, may outwardly be a demon or be born in a family of demons. Therefore in terms of real culture one should not be considered a demigod or demon simply according to birth. In his dealings while fighting with Indra, Vritr&#257;sura proved himself a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, as soon as he finished fighting with Indra and was apparently killed, Vritr&#257;sura was transferred to Vaikunthaloka to become an associate of Sa&#324;karshana. Indra knew this, and therefore he was morose at having killed such a demon, who was actually a Vaishnava or br&#257;hmana.</P><P>A Vaishnava is already a br&#257;hmana, although a br&#257;hmana may not be a Vaishnava. The Padma Pur&#257;na says:</P><P>shat-karma-nipuno vipro</P><P CLASS=n>mantra-tantra-vi&#347;&#257;radah</P><P CLASS=n>avaishnavo gurur na sy&#257;d</P><P CLASS=n>vaishnavah &#347;va-paco guruh</P><P>One may be a br&#257;hmana in terms of his culture and family and may be expert in Vedic knowledge (mantra-tantra-vi&#347;&#257;radah), but if he is not a Vaishnava, he cannot be a guru. This means that an expert br&#257;hmana may not be a Vaishnava, but a Vaishnava is already a br&#257;hmana. A millionaire may very easily possess hundreds and thousands of dollars, but a person with hundreds and thousands of dollars is not necessarily a millionaire. Vritr&#257;sura was a perfect Vaishnava, and therefore he was also a br&#257;hmana.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
