In the beginning of his life Aj&#257;mila was certainly very pure, and he associated with devotees and br&#257;hmanas; because of that pious activity, even though he was fallen, he was inspired to name his son N&#257;r&#257;yana. Certainly this was due to good counsel given from within by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">15.15</A>), sarvasya c&#257;ham hridi sannivishto mattah smritir jñ&#257;nam apohanam ca: "I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." The Lord, who is situated in everyone's heart, is so kind that if one has ever rendered service to Him, the Lord never forgets him. Thus the Lord, from within, gave Aj&#257;mila the opportunity to name his youngest son N&#257;r&#257;yana so that in affection he would constantly call "N&#257;r&#257;yana! N&#257;r&#257;yana!" and thus be saved from the most fearful and dangerous condition at the time of his death. Such is the mercy of Krishna. Guru-krishna-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja: by the mercy of the guru and Krishna, one receives the seed of bhakti. This association saves a devotee from the greatest fear. In our Krishna consciousness movement we therefore change a devotee's name to a form that reminds him of Vishnu. If at the time of death the devotee can remember his own name, such as Krishnad&#257;sa or Govinda d&#257;sa, he can be saved from the greatest danger. Therefore the change of names at the time of initiation is essential. The Krishna consciousness movement is so meticulous that it gives one a good opportunity to remember Krishna somehow or other.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
