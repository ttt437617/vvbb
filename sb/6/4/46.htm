The ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices, when properly conducted, are the various limbs of My body, the unseen good fortune proceeding from pious or spiritual activities constitutes My mind, and the demigods who execute My orders in various departments are My life and soul.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Sometimes atheists argue that since God is invisible to their eyes, they do not believe in God. For them the Supreme Lord is describing a method by which one can see God in His impersonal form. Intelligent persons can see God in His personal form, as stated in the &#347;&#257;stras, but if one is very eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead immediately, face to face, he can see the Supreme Lord through this description, which portrays the various internal and external parts of His body.</P><P>To engage in tapasya, or denial of material activities, is the first principle of spiritual life. Then there are spiritual activities, such as the performance of Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, study of the Vedic knowledge, meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and chanting of the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra. One should also respect the demigods and understand how they are situated, how they act and how they manage the activities of the various departments of this material world. In this way one can see how God is existing and how everything is managed perfectly because of the presence of the Supreme Lord. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/10.htm">9.10</A>):</P><P>may&#257;dhyakshena prakritih</P><P CLASS=n>s&#363;yate sa-car&#257;caram</P><P CLASS=n>hetun&#257;nena kaunteya</P><P CLASS=n>jagad viparivartate</P><P>"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt&#299;, and it is producing all moving and nonmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again." If one is unable to see the Supreme Lord although He is present as Krishna in His various incarnations, one may see the Supreme Lord's impersonal feature, according to the direction of the Vedas, by seeing the activities of material nature.</P><P>Anything done under the direction of the Vedic injunctions is called dharma, as described by the order carriers of Yamar&#257;ja (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/6/1/40.htm">6.1.40</A>):</P><P>veda-pranihito dharmo</P><P CLASS=n>hy adharmas tad-viparyayah</P><P CLASS=n>vedo n&#257;r&#257;yanah s&#257;ksh&#257;t</P><P CLASS=n>svayambh&#363;r iti &#347;u&#347;ruma</P><P>"That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion.
