My desire also is that everyone within this world be happy. I am therefore very pleased with you because you are endeavoring to fulfill My desire for the welfare of the entire world.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>After every dissolution of the material cosmos, all the living entities take shelter in the body of K&#257;ranodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu, and when creation takes place again, they come forth from His body in their various species to resume their activities. Why does the creation take place in such a way that the living entities are put into conditioned life to suffer the threefold miseries imposed upon them by the material nature? Here the Lord says to Daksha, "You desire to benefit all living entities, and that is also My desire." The living entities who come in contact with the material world are meant to be corrected. All the living entities within this material world have revolted against the service of the Lord, and therefore they remain within this material world as ever conditioned, nitya-baddha, taking birth again and again. There is a chance, of course, of their being liberated, but nevertheless the conditioned souls, not taking advantage of this opportunity, continue in a life of sense enjoyment, and thus they are punished by birth and death again and again. This is the law of nature. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/14.htm">7.14</A>):</P><P>daiv&#299; hy esh&#257; guna-may&#299;</P><P CLASS=n>mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante</P><P CLASS=n>m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;m taranti te</P><P>"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." Elsewhere in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/7.htm">15.7</A>) the Lord says:</P><P>mamaiv&#257;m&#347;o j&#299;va-loke</P><P CLASS=n>j&#299;va-bh&#363;tah san&#257;tanah</P><P CLASS=n>manah shashth&#257;n&#299;ndriy&#257;ni</P><P CLASS=n>prakriti-sth&#257;ni karshati</P><P>"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." The living entity's struggle for existence within the material world is due to his rebellious nature. Unless a living entity surrenders to Krishna, he must continue this life of struggle.</P><P>The Krishna consciousness movement is not a fad. It is a bona fide movement intended to promote the welfare of all conditioned souls by trying to elevate everyone to the platform of Krishna consciousness. If one does not come to this platform, he must continue in material existence perpetually, sometimes in the upper planets and sometimes in the lower planets. As confirmed in Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/20/118.htm">Madhya 20.118</A>), kabhu svarge uth&#257;ya, kabhu narake dub&#257;ya: the conditioned soul sometimes descends into nescience and sometimes gets some relief by being relatively freed from it. This is the life of the conditioned soul.</P><P>Praj&#257;pati Daksha is trying to benefit the conditioned souls by begetting them to give them a life with a chance for liberation. Liberation means surrender to Krishna. If one begets children with the purpose of training them to surrender to Krishna, fatherhood is very good. Similarly, when the spiritual master trains the conditioned souls to become Krishna conscious, his position is successful. If one gives the conditioned souls a chance to become Krishna conscious, all his activities are approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is extremely pleased, as stated here (pr&#299;to 'ham). Following the examples of the previous &#257;c&#257;ryas, all the members of the Krishna consciousness movement should try to benefit the conditioned souls by inducing them to become Krishna conscious and giving them all facilities to do so. Such activities constitute real welfare work. By such activities, a preacher or anyone who endeavors to spread Krishna consciousness is recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/68.htm">18.68-69</A>):</P><P>ya idam paramam guhyam</P><P CLASS=n>mad-bhakteshv abhidh&#257;syati</P><P CLASS=n>bhaktim mayi par&#257;m kritv&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>m&#257;m evaishyaty asam&#347;ayah</P><P CLASS=n>na ca tasm&#257;n manushyeshu</P><P CLASS=n>ka&#347;cin me priya-krittamah</P><P CLASS=n>bhavit&#257; na ca me tasm&#257;d</P><P CLASS=n>anyah priyataro bhuvi</P><P>"For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.
