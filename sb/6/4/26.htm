Then one's material vision and the memories of the mind, which manifests names and forms, are vanquished. Only in such a trance is the Supreme Personality of Godhead revealed. Thus let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seen in that uncontaminated, transcendental state.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>There are two stages of God realization. One is called sujñeyam, or very easily understood (generally by mental speculation), and the other is called durjñeyam, understood only with difficulty. Param&#257;tm&#257; realization and Brahman realization are considered sujñeyam, but realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is durjñeyam. As described here, one attains the ultimate realization of the Personality of Godhead when one gives up the activities of the mind &#8212; thinking, feeling and willing &#8212; or, in other words, when mental speculation stops. This transcendental realization is above susupti, deep sleep. In our gross conditional stage we perceive things through material experience and remembrance, and in the subtle stage we perceive the world in dreams. The process of vision also involves remembrance and also exists in a subtle form. Above gross experience and dreams is susupti, deep sleep, and when one comes to the completely spiritual platform, transcending deep sleep, he attains trance, vi&#347;uddha-sattva, or vasudeva-sattva, in which the Personality of Godhead is revealed.</P><P>Atah &#347;r&#299;-krishna-n&#257;m&#257;di na bhaved gr&#257;hyam indriyaih: [BRS. 1.2.234] as long as one is situated in duality, on the sensual platform, gross or subtle, realization of the original Personality of Godhead is impossible. Sevonmukhe hi jihv&#257;dau svayam eva sphuraty adah: but when one engages his senses in the service of the Lord &#8212; specifically, when one engages the tongue in chanting the Hare Krishna mantra and tasting only Krishna pras&#257;da with a spirit of service &#8212; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is revealed. This is indicated in this verse by the word &#347;uci-sadmane. &#346;uci means purified. By the spirit of rendering service with one's senses, one's entire existence becomes &#347;uci-sadma, the platform of uncontaminated purity. Daksha therefore offers his respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is revealed on the platform of &#347;uci-sadma. In this regard &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura quotes the following prayer by Lord Brahm&#257; from the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../10/14/6.htm">10.14.6</A>): tath&#257;pi bh&#363;man mahim&#257;gunasya te viboddhum arhaty amal&#257;ntar-&#257;tmabhih. "One whose heart has become completely purified, my Lord, can understand the transcendental qualities of Your Lordship and can understand the greatness of Your activities."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="27-28.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
