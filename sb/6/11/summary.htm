When the prominent commanders of the demons fled, not hearing Vritr&#257;sura's advice. Vritr&#257;sura condemned them all as cowards. Speaking very bravely, he stood alone to face the demigods. When the demigods saw Vritr&#257;sura's attitude, they were so afraid that they practically fainted, and Vritr&#257;sura began trampling them down. Unable to tolerate this, Indra, the King of the demigods, threw his club at Vritr&#257;sura, but Vritr&#257;sura was such a great hero that he easily caught the club with his left hand and used it to beat Indra's elephant. Struck by the blow of Vritr&#257;sura, the elephant was pushed back fourteen yards and fell, with Indra on its back.</P><P>King Indra had first accepted Vi&#347;var&#363;pa as his priest and thereafter killed him. Reminding Indra of his heinous activities, Vritr&#257;sura said, "If one is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vishnu, and depends on Lord Vishnu in every respect, then victory, opulence and peace of mind are all inevitably available. Such a person has nothing for which to aspire in the three worlds. The Supreme Lord is so kind that He especially favors such a devotee by not giving him opulence that will hamper his devotional service. Therefore I wish to give up everything for the service of the Lord. I wish always to chant the glories of the Lord and engage in His service. Let me become unattached to my worldly family and make friendships with the devotees of the Lord. I do not desire to be promoted to the higher planetary systems, even to Dhruvaloka or Brahmaloka, nor do I desire an unconquerable position within this material world. I have no need for such things."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../10/33.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
