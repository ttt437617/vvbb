Such a devotee is like an experienced physician, who never encourages a patient to eat food injurious to his health, even if the patient desires it.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Here is the difference between the benedictions awarded by the demigods and those awarded by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu. Devotees of the demigods ask for benedictions simply for sense gratification, and therefore they have been described in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/20.htm">7.20</A>) as bereft of intelligence.</P><P>k&#257;mais tais tair hrita-jñ&#257;n&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>prapadyante 'nya-devat&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>tam tam niyamam &#257;sth&#257;ya</P><P CLASS=n>prakrity&#257; niyat&#257;h svay&#257;</P><P>"Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures."</P><P>Conditioned souls are generally bereft of intelligence because of profound desires for sense gratification. They do not know what benedictions to ask. Therefore nondevotees are advised in the &#347;&#257;stras to worship various demigods to achieve material benefits. For example, if one wants a beautiful wife, he is advised to worship Um&#257;, or goddess Durg&#257;. If one wants to be cured of a disease, he is advised to worship the sun-god. All requests for benedictions from the demigods, however, are due to material lust. The benedictions will be finished at the end of the cosmic manifestation, along with those who bestow them. If one approaches Lord Vishnu for benedictions, the Lord will give him a benediction that will help him return home, back to Godhead. This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/10.htm">10.10</A>):</P><P>tesh&#257;m satata-yukt&#257;n&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>bhajat&#257;m pr&#299;ti-p&#363;rvakam</P><P CLASS=n>dad&#257;mi buddhi-yogam tam</P><P CLASS=n>yena m&#257;m upay&#257;nti te</P><P>Lord Vishnu, or Lord Krishna, instructs a devotee who constantly engages in His service how to approach Him at the end of his material body. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/9.htm">4.9</A>):</P><P>janma karma ca me divyam</P><P CLASS=n>evam yo vetti tattvatah</P><P CLASS=n>tyaktv&#257; deham punar janma</P><P CLASS=n>naiti m&#257;m eti so 'rjuna</P><P>"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities, does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." This is the benediction of Lord Vishnu, Krishna. After giving up his body, a devotee returns home, back to Godhead.</P><P>A devotee may foolishly ask for material benedictions, but Lord Krishna does not give him such benedictions, despite the devotee's prayers. Therefore people who are very attached to material life do not generally become devotees of Krishna or Vishnu. Instead they become devotees of the demigods (k&#257;mais tais tair hrita jñ&#257;n&#257;h prapadyante 'nya-devat&#257;h [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/20.htm">Bg. 7.20</A>]). The benedictions of the demigods, however, are condemned in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. Antavat tu phalam tesh&#257;m tad bhavaty alpa-medhas&#257;m: "Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary." A non-Vaishnava, one who is not engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered a fool with a small quantity of brain substance.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
