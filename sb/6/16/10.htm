He makes no distinction between that which is his own and that which belongs to anyone else. He is one without a second; in other words, he is not affected by friends and enemies, well-wishers or mischief-mongers. He is only an observer, a witness, of the different qualities of men.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>As explained in the previous verse, the living entity has the same qualities as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he has them in minute quantities because he is a small particle (s&#363;kshma) whereas the Supreme Lord is all-pervading and great. For the Supreme Lord there are no friends, enemies or relatives, for He is completely free from all the disqualifications of ignorance that characterize the conditioned souls. On the other hand, He is extremely kind and favorable to His devotees, and He is not at all satisfied with persons who are envious of His devotees. As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/29.htm">9.29</A>):</P><P>samo 'ham sarva-bh&#363;teshu</P><P CLASS=n>na me dveshyo 'sti na priyah</P><P CLASS=n>ye bhajanti tu m&#257;m bhakty&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>mayi te teshu c&#257;py aham</P><P>"I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him." The Supreme Lord has no enemy or friend, but He is inclined toward a devotee who always engages in His devotional service. Similarly, elsewhere in the G&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/16/19.htm">16.19</A>) the Lord says:</P><P>t&#257;n aham dvishatah kr&#363;r&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>sams&#257;reshu nar&#257;dham&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>kship&#257;my ajasram a&#347;ubh&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>&#257;sur&#299;shv eva yonishu</P><P>"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life." The Lord is extremely antagonistic toward those who are envious of His devotees. To protect His devotees, the Lord sometimes has to kill their enemies. For example, to protect Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the Lord had to kill his enemy Hiranyaka&#347;ipu, although Hiranyaka&#347;ipu attained salvation because of being killed by the Lord. Since the Lord is the witness of everyone's activities, He witnesses the actions of the enemies of His devotees, and He is inclined to punish them. In other cases, however, He simply witnesses what the living entities do and gives the results of one's sinful or pious actions.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
