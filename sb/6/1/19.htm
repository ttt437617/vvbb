Even in dreams, such surrendered souls do not see Yamar&#257;ja or his order carriers, who are equipped with ropes to bind the sinful.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Krishna says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/66.htm">18.66</A>):</P><P>sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya</P><P CLASS=n>m&#257;m ekam &#347;aranam vraja</P><P CLASS=n>aham tv&#257;m sarva-p&#257;pebhyo</P><P CLASS=n>mokshayishy&#257;mi m&#257; &#347;ucah</P><P>"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear." This same principle is described here (sakrin manah krishna-pad&#257;ravindayoh). If by studying Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; one decides to surrender to Krishna, he is immediately freed from all sinful reactions. It is also significant that &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, having several times repeated the words v&#257;sudeva-par&#257;yana and n&#257;r&#257;yana-par&#257;yana, finally says krishna-pad&#257;ravindayoh. Thus he indicates that Krishna is the origin of both N&#257;r&#257;yana and V&#257;sudeva. Even though N&#257;r&#257;yana and V&#257;sudeva are not different from Krishna, simply by surrendering to Krishna one fully surrenders to all His expansions, such as N&#257;r&#257;yana, V&#257;sudeva and Govinda. As Krishna says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/7.htm">7.7</A>), mattah parataram n&#257;nyat: "There is no truth superior to Me." There are many names and forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Krishna is the supreme form (krishnas tu bhagav&#257;n svayam). Therefore Krishna recommends to neophyte devotees that one should surrender unto Him only (m&#257;m ekam). Because neophyte devotees cannot understand what the forms of N&#257;r&#257;yana, V&#257;sudeva and Govinda are, Krishna directly says, m&#257;m ekam. Herein, this is also supported by the word krishna-pad&#257;ravindayoh. N&#257;r&#257;yana does not speak personally, but Krishna, or V&#257;sudeva, does, as in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; for example. Therefore, to follow the direction of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; means to surrender unto Krishna, and to surrender in this way is the highest perfection of bhakti-yoga.</P><P>Par&#299;kshit Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had inquired from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; how one can be saved from falling into the various conditions of hellish life. In this verse &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; answers that a soul who has surrendered to Krishna certainly cannot go to naraka, hellish existence. To say nothing of going there, even in his dreams he does not see Yamar&#257;ja or his order carriers, who are able to take one there. In other words, if one wants to save himself from falling into naraka, hellish life, he should fully surrender to Krishna. The word sakrit is significant because it indicates that if one sincerely surrenders to Krishna once, he is saved even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful activities. Therefore Krishna says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/30.htm">9.30</A>):</P><P>api cet su-dur&#257;c&#257;ro</P><P CLASS=n>bhajate m&#257;m ananya-bh&#257;k</P><P CLASS=n>s&#257;dhur eva sa mantavyah</P><P CLASS=n>samyag vyavasito hi sah</P><P>"Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated." If one never for a moment forgets Krishna, he is safe even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful acts.</P><P>In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/2/40.htm">2.40</A>) the Lord also says:</P><P>neh&#257;bhikrama-n&#257;&#347;o 'sti</P><P CLASS=n>pratyav&#257;yo na vidyate</P><P CLASS=n>svalpam apy asya dharmasya</P><P CLASS=n>tr&#257;yate mahato bhay&#257;t</P><P>"In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear."</P><P>Elsewhere in the G&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/6/40.htm">6.40</A>) the Lord says, na hi kaly&#257;na-krit ka&#347;cid durgatim t&#257;ta gacchati: "one who performs auspicious activity is never overcome by evil." The highest kaly&#257;na (auspicious) activity is to surrender to Krishna. That is the only path by which to save oneself from falling down into hellish life. &#346;r&#299;la Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299; has confirmed this as follows:</P><P>kaivalyam narak&#257;yate tri-da&#347;a-p&#363;r &#257;k&#257;&#347;a-pushp&#257;yate</P><P CLASS=n>durd&#257;ntendriya-k&#257;la-sarpa-patal&#299; protkh&#257;ta-damshtr&#257;yate</P><P CLASS=n>vi&#347;vam p&#363;rna-sukh&#257;yate vidhi-mahendr&#257;di&#347; ca k&#299;t&#257;yate</P><P CLASS=n>yat-k&#257;runya-kat&#257;ksha-vaibhavavat&#257;m tam gauram eva stumah</P><P>The sinful actions of one who has surrendered unto Krishna are compared to a snake with its poison fangs removed (protkh&#257;ta-damshtr&#257;yate). Such a snake is no longer to be feared. Of course, one should not commit sinful activities on the strength of having surrendered to Krishna. However, even if one who has surrendered to Krishna happens to do something sinful because of his former habits, such sinful actions no longer have a destructive effect. Therefore one should adhere to the lotus feet of Krishna very tightly and serve Him under the direction of the spiritual master. Thus in all conditions one will be akuto-bhaya, free from fear.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
