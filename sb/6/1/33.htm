Are you demigods from the heavenly planets, are you sub-demigods, or are you the best of devotees?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The most significant word used in this verse is siddha-sattam&#257;h, which means "the best of the perfect." In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/3.htm">7.3</A>) it is said, manushy&#257;n&#257;m sahasreshu ka&#347;cid yatati siddhaye: out of millions of persons, one may try to become siddha, perfect &#8212; or, in other words, self-realized. A self-realized person knows that he is not the body but a spiritual soul (aham brahm&#257;smi). At the present moment practically everyone is unaware of this fact, but one who understands this has attained perfection and is therefore called siddha. When one understands that the soul is part and parcel of the supreme soul and one thus engages in the devotional service of the supreme soul, one becomes siddha-sat-tama. One is then eligible to live in the Vaikuntha planets or Krishnaloka. The word siddha-sattama, therefore, refers to a liberated, pure devotee.</P><P>Since the Yamad&#363;tas are servants of Yamar&#257;ja, who is also one of the siddha-sattamas, they knew that a siddha-sattama is above the demigods and sub-demigods and, indeed, above all the living entities within this material world. The Yamad&#363;tas therefore inquired why the Vishnud&#363;tas were present where a sinful man was going to die.</P><P>It should also be noted that Aj&#257;mila was not yet dead, for the Yamad&#363;tas were trying to snatch the soul from his heart. They could not take the soul, however, and therefore Aj&#257;mila was not yet dead. This will be revealed in later verses. Aj&#257;mila was simply in an unconscious state when the argument was in progress between the Yamad&#363;tas and the Vishnud&#363;tas. The conclusion of the argument was to be a decision regarding who would claim the soul of Aj&#257;mila.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="34-36.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
