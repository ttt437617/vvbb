Illusioned by the glaring reflection of the external energy, the living entities worship the senses instead of engaging them properly in fulfilling the desires of the Supreme.</P><P>In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/sudhodaya/13/2">13.2</A>) there is the following verse:</P><P>akshnoh phalam tv&#257;dri&#347;a-dar&#347;anam hi</P><P CLASS=n>tanoh phalam tv&#257;dri&#347;a-g&#257;tra-sa&#324;gah</P><P CLASS=n>jihv&#257;-phalam tv&#257;dri&#347;a-k&#299;rtanam hi</P><P CLASS=n>sudurlabh&#257; bh&#257;gavat&#257; hi loke</P><P>"O devotee of the Lord, the purpose of the visual sense is fulfilled simply by seeing you, and to touch your body is the fulfillment of bodily touch. The tongue is meant for glorifying your qualities because in this world a pure devotee of the Lord is very difficult to find."</P><P>Originally the senses of the living entity were awarded for this purpose, namely to engage them in the transcendental loving service of the Lord or that of His devotees, but the conditioned souls, illusioned by the material energy, became captivated by sense enjoyment. Therefore the whole process of God consciousness is meant to rectify the conditional activities of the senses and to re-engage them in the direct service of the Lord. Lord Brahm&#257; thus engaged his senses in the Lord by re-creating the conditioned living entities to act in the re-created universe. This material universe is thus created and annihilated by the will of the Lord. It is created to give the conditioned soul a chance to act to return home, back to Godhead, and servants like Brahm&#257;j&#299;, N&#257;radaj&#299;, Vy&#257;saj&#299; and their company become busy with the same purpose of the Lord: to reclaim the conditioned souls from the field of sense gratification and return them to the normal stage of engaging the senses in service of the Lord. Instead of doing so, i.e. converting the actions of the senses, the impersonalists began to make the conditioned souls sense-less, and the Lord also senseless. That is improper treatment for the conditioned souls. The diseased condition of the senses may be treated by curing the defect, but not uprooting the senses altogether. When there is some disease in the eyes, the eyes may be cured to see properly. Plucking out the eyes is no treatment. Similarly, the whole material disease is based on the process of sense gratification, and liberation from the diseased condition is re-engagement of the senses to see the beauty of the Lord, hear His glories, and act on His account. Thus Brahm&#257;j&#299; created the universal activities again.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
