He is more than a simple creator and destroyer, for there is His feature of &#257;nanda, or His pleasure feature. This pleasure feature of the Lord is understood by the pure devotees only, and not by others. The impersonalist is satisfied simply by understanding the all-pervasive influence of the Lord. This is called Brahman realization. Greater than the impersonalist is the mystic who sees the Lord situated in his heart as Param&#257;tm&#257;, the partial representation of the Lord. But there are pure devotees who take part in the direct pleasure (&#257;nanda) potency of the Lord by factual reciprocation of loving service. The Lord in His abode called the Vaikuntha planets, which are eternal manifestations, always remains with His associates and enjoys transcendental loving services by His pure devotees in different transcendental humors. The pure devotees of the Lord thus undergo a practice of that devotional service to the Lord during the manifestation of the creation and take full advantage of the manifestation by qualifying themselves to enter into the kingdom of God. The Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/55.htm">18.55</A>) confirms this:</P><P>bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti</P><P CLASS=n>y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvatah</P><P CLASS=n>tato m&#257;m tattvato jñ&#257;tv&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>vi&#347;ate tad-anantaram</P><P>By development of pure devotional service one can factually know the Lord as He is and thus be trained in the bona fide service of the Lord and be allowed to enter into the direct association of the Lord in so many capacities. The highest glorious association with the Lord is made possible in the planet of Goloka Vrind&#257;vana, where Lord Krishna enjoys Himself with the gop&#299;s and His favorite animals, the surabhi cows. A description of this transcendental land of Krishna is given in the Brahma-samhit&#257;, which is considered by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya to be the most authentic literature in this connection.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
