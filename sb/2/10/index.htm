The Manus and their laws are meant to give right direction in life. The impetus for activity is the desire for fruitive work.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 2.10.5</B></A>: The science of God describes the incarnations of the Personality of Godhead and His different activities together with the activities of His great devotees.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 2.10.6</B></A>: The merging of the living entity, along with his conditional living tendency, with the mystic lying down of the Mah&#257;-Vishnu is called the winding up of the cosmic manifestation. Liberation is the permanent situation of the form of the living entity after he gives up the changeable gross and subtle material bodies.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 2.10.7</B></A>: The supreme one who is celebrated as the Supreme Being or the Supreme Soul is the supreme source of the cosmic manifestation as well as its reservoir and winding up. Thus He is the Supreme Fountainhead, the Absolute Truth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 2.10.8</B></A>: The individual person possessing different instruments of senses is called the adhy&#257;tmic person, and the individual controlling deity of the senses is called adhidaivic. The embodiment seen on the eyeballs is called the adhibhautic person.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 2.10.9</B></A>: All three of the above-mentioned stages of different living entities are interdependent. In the absence of one, another is not understood. But the Supreme Being who sees every one of them as the shelter of the shelter is independent of all, and therefore He is the supreme shelter.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 2.10.10</B></A>: After separating the different universes, the gigantic universal form of the Lord [Mah&#257;-Vishnu], which came out of the causal ocean, the place of appearance for the first purusha-avat&#257;ra, entered into each of the separate universes, desiring to lie on the created transcendental water [Garbhodaka].</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 2.10.11</B></A>: That Supreme Person is not impersonal and therefore is distinctively a nara, or person.

After this all the different tastes came into existence so that the tongue can relish them.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 2.10.19</B></A>: When the Supreme desired to speak, speeches were vibrated from the mouth.

Then the eyes, the illuminating god Sun, the power of vision and the object of sight all became manifested.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>SB 2.10.22</B></A>: By development of the desire of the great sages to know, the ears, the power of hearing, the controlling deity of hearing, and the objects of hearing became manifested. The great sages desired to hear about the Self.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>SB 2.10.23</B></A>: When there was a desire to perceive the physical characteristics of matter, such as softness, hardness, warmth, cold, lightness and heaviness, the background of sensation, the skin, the skin pores, the hairs on the body and their controlling deities (the trees) were generated. Within and outside the skin is a covering of air through which sense perception became prominent.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>SB 2.10.24</B></A>: Thereafter when the Supreme Person desired to perform varieties of work, the two hands and their controlling strength, and Indra, the demigod in heaven, became manifested, as also the acts dependent on both the hands and the demigod.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm"><B>SB 2.10.25</B></A>: Thereupon, because of His desiring to control movement, His legs became manifested, and from the legs the controlling deity named Vishnu was generated. By His personal supervision of this act, all varieties of human being are busily engaged in dutiful occupational sacrifice.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>SB 2.10.26</B></A>: Thereupon, for sexual pleasure, begetting offspring and tasting heavenly nectar, the Lord developed the genitals, and thus there is the genital organ and its controlling deity, the Praj&#257;pati. The object of sexual pleasure and the controlling deity are under the control of the genitals of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>SB 2.10.27</B></A>: Thereafter, when He desired to evacuate the refuse of eatables, the evacuating hole, anus, and the sensory organ thereof developed along with the controlling deity Mitra. The sensory organ and the evacuating substance are both under the shelter of the controlling deity.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 2.10.28</B></A>: Thereafter, when He desired to move from one body to another, the navel and the air of departure and death were combinedly created. The navel is the shelter for both, namely death and the separating force.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>SB 2.10.29</B></A>: When there was a desire to have food and drink, the abdomen and the intestines and also the arteries became manifested. The rivers and seas are the source of their sustenance and metabolism.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 2.10.30</B></A>: When there was a desire to think about the activities of His own energy, then the heart (the seat of the mind), the mind, the moon, determination and all desire became manifested.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 2.10.31</B></A>: The seven elements of the body, namely the thin layer on the skin, the skin itself, the flesh, blood, fat, marrow and bone, are all made of earth, water and fire, whereas the life breath is produced by the sky, water and air.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>SB 2.10.32</B></A>: The sense organs are attached to the modes of material nature, and the modes of material nature are products of the false ego. The mind is subjected to all kinds of material experiences (happiness and distress), and the intelligence is the feature of the mind's deliberation.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>SB 2.10.33</B></A>: Thus by all this, the external feature of the Personality of Godhead is covered by gross forms such as those of planets, which were explained to you by me.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>SB 2.10.34</B></A>: Therefore beyond this [gross manifestation] is a transcendental manifestation finer than the finest form. It has no beginning, no intermediate stage and no end; therefore it is beyond the limits of expression or mental speculation and is distinct from the material conception.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm"><B>SB 2.10.35</B></A>: Neither of the above forms of the Lord, as just described unto you from the material angle of vision, is accepted by the pure devotees of the Lord who know Him well.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>SB 2.10.36</B></A>: He, the Personality of Godhead, manifests Himself in a transcendental form, being the subject of His transcendental name, quality, pastimes, entourage and transcendental variegatedness. Although He is unaffected by all such activities, He appears to be so engaged.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37-40.htm"><B>SB 2.10.37-40</B></A>: O King, know from me that all living entities are created by the Supreme Lord according to their past deeds. This includes Brahm&#257; and his sons like Daksha, the periodical heads like Vaivasvata Manu, the demigods like Indra, Candra and Varuna, the great sages like Bhrigu, Vy&#257;sa and Vasishtha, the inhabitants of Pitriloka and Siddhaloka, the C&#257;ranas, Gandharvas, Vidy&#257;dharas, Asuras, Yakshas, Kinnaras and angels, the serpentines, the monkey-shaped Kimpurushas, the human beings, the inhabitants of M&#257;triloka, the demons, Pi&#347;&#257;cas, ghosts, spirits, lunatics and evil spirits, the good and evil stars, the goblins, the animals in the forest, the birds, the household animals, the reptiles, the mountains, the moving and standing living entities, the living entities born from embryos, from eggs, from perspiration and from seeds, and all others, whether they be in the water, land or sky, in happiness, in distress or in mixed happiness and distress. All of them, according to their past deeds, are created by the Supreme Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm"><B>SB 2.10.41</B></A>: According to the different modes of material nature &#8212; the mode of goodness, the mode of passion and the mode of darkness &#8212; there are different living creatures, who are known as demigods, human beings and hellish living entities. O King, even a particular mode of nature, being mixed with the other two, is divided into three, and thus each kind of living creature is influenced by the other modes and acquires its habits also.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm"><B>SB 2.10.42</B></A>: He, the Personality of Godhead, as the maintainer of all in the universe, appears in different incarnations after establishing the creation, and thus He reclaims all kinds of conditioned souls amongst the humans, the nonhumans and the demigods.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm"><B>SB 2.10.43</B></A>: Thereafter, at the end of the millennium, the Lord Himself in the form of Rudra, the destroyer, will annihilate the complete creation as the wind displaces the clouds.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm"><B>SB 2.10.44</B></A>: The great transcendentalists thus describe the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the pure devotees deserve to see more glorious things in transcendence, beyond these features.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm"><B>SB 2.10.45</B></A>: There is no direct engineering by the Lord for the creation and destruction of the material world. What is described in the Vedas about His direct interference is simply to counteract the idea that material nature is the creator.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm"><B>SB 2.10.46</B></A>: This process of creation and annihilation described in summary herein is the regulative principle during the duration of Brahm&#257;'s one day. It is also the regulative principle in the creation of mahat, in which the material nature is dispersed.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm"><B>SB 2.10.47</B></A>: O King, I shall in due course explain the measurement of time in its gross and subtle features with the specific symptoms of each, but for the present let me explain unto you the P&#257;dma-kalpa.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm"><B>SB 2.10.48</B></A>: &#346;aunaka Rishi, after hearing all about the creation, inquired from S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; about Vidura, for S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; had previously informed him how Vidura left home, leaving aside all his relatives, who were very difficult to leave.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="49-50.htm"><B>SB 2.10.49-50</B></A>: &#346;aunaka Rishi said: Let us know, please, what topics were discussed between Vidura and Maitreya, who talked on transcendental subjects, and what was inquired by Vidura and replied by Maitreya. Also please let us know the reason for Vidura's giving up the connection of his family members, and why he again came home. Please also let us know the activities of Vidura while he was in the places of pilgrimage.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm"><B>SB 2.10.51</B></A>: &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; explained: I shall now explain to you the very subjects explained by the great sage in answer to King Par&#299;kshit's inquiries.
