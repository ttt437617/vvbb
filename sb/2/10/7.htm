The word iti used here in this verse completes the synonyms and thus indicates Bhagav&#257;n. This will be further explained in the later verses, but this Bhagav&#257;n ultimately means Lord Krishna because the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam has already accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Krishna. Krishnas tu bhagav&#257;n svayam. The original source of all energies, or the summum bonum, is the Absolute Truth, which is called Parambrahma, etc., and Bhagav&#257;n is the last word of the Absolute Truth. But even with the synonyms for Bhagav&#257;n, such as N&#257;r&#257;yana, Vishnu and Purusha, the last word is Krishna, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;: aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah samam pravartate [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/8.htm">Bg. 10.8</A>], etc. Besides that, the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is the representation of Lord Krishna as a sound incarnation of the Lord.</P><P>krishne sva-dh&#257;mopagate</P><P CLASS=n>dharma-jñ&#257;n&#257;dibhih saha</P><P CLASS=n>kalau nashta-dri&#347;&#257;m eshah</P><P CLASS=n>pur&#257;n&#257;rko 'dhunoditah</P><P>(Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/3/43.htm">1.3.43</A>)</P><P>Thus by general conclusion Lord Krishna is the ultimate source of all energies, and the word Krishna means that. And to explain Krishna or the science of Krishna, the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam has been prepared. In the First Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam this truth is indicated in the questions and answers by S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; and great sages like &#346;aunaka, and in the First and Second Chapters of the canto this is explained. In the Third Chapter this subject is more explicit, and in the Fourth Chapter even more explicit. In the Second Canto the Absolute Truth as the personality of Godhead is further emphasized, and the indication is the Supreme Lord Krishna. The summary of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam in four verses, as we have already discussed, is succinct. This Supreme Personality of Godhead in the ultimate issue is confirmed by Brahm&#257; in his Brahma-samhit&#257; as &#299;&#347;varah paramah krishnah sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigrahah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>]. So it is concluded in the Third Canto of the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam. The complete subject matter is elaborately explained in the Tenth and Eleventh Cantos of the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam. In the matter of the changes of the Manus or manvantaras, such as the Sv&#257;yambhuva-manvantara and C&#257;kshusha-manvantara, as they are discussed in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Cantos of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, Lord Krishna is indicated. In the Eighth Canto the Vaivasvata-manvantara explains the same subject indirectly, and in the Ninth Canto the same purport is there. In the Twelfth Canto the same is further explained, specifically regarding the different incarnations of the Lord. Thus it is concluded by studying the complete &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam that Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna is the ultimate summum bonum, or the ultimate source of all energy. And according to the grades of worshipers, the indications of the nomenclature may be differently explained as N&#257;r&#257;yana, Brahm&#257;, Param&#257;tm&#257;, etc.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
