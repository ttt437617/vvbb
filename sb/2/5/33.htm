He expands Himself by His different energies, as well as by His plenary portions. In a corner of the spiritual sky of brahmajyoti a spiritual cloud sometimes appears, and the covered portion is called the mahat-tattva. The Lord then, by His plenary portion as Mah&#257;-Vishnu, lies down within the water of the mahat-tattva, and the water is called the Causal Ocean (K&#257;rana-jala). While Mah&#257;-Vishnu sleeps within the Causal Ocean, innumerable universes are generated along with His breathing. These universes are floating, and they are scattered all over the Causal Ocean. They stay only during the breathing period of Mah&#257;-Vishnu. In each and every universal globe, the same Mah&#257;-Vishnu enters again as Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu and lies there on the serpentlike &#346;esha incarnation. From His navel sprouts a lotus stem, and on the lotus, Brahm&#257;, the lord of the universe, is born. Brahm&#257; creates all forms of living beings of different shapes in terms of different desires within the universe. He also creates the sun, moon and other demigods.</P><P>Therefore the chief engineer of the material creation is the Lord Himself, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/10.htm">9.10</A>). It is He only who directs the material nature to produce all sorts of moving and nonmoving creations.</P><P>There are two modes of material creation: the creation of the collective universes, as stated above, done by the Mah&#257;-Vishnu, and the creation of the single universe. Both are done by the Lord, and thus the universal shape, as we can see, takes place.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
