Such regulated activities prescribed in the Vedas are called the karma-k&#257;nd&#299;ya conception of life, and householders are generally recommended to follow the rules just to enjoy material prosperity both in this life and in the next. Most people are attracted by such activities. Even in the activities of their modern godless civilization, people are more concerned with economic development and sense gratification without any religious sentiments. As a great emperor of the world, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit had to observe such regulations of the Vedic karma-k&#257;nd&#299;ya section, but by his slight association with &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; he could perfectly understand that Lord Krishna, the Absolute Personality of Godhead (V&#257;sudeva), for whom he had a natural love since his birth, is everything, and thus he fixed his mind firmly upon Him, renouncing all modes of Vedic karma-k&#257;nd&#299;ya activities. This perfectional stage is attained by a jñ&#257;n&#299; after many, many births. The jñ&#257;n&#299;s, or the empiric philosophers endeavoring for liberation, are thousands of times better than the fruitive workers, and out of hundreds of thousands of such jñ&#257;n&#299;s one is liberated factually. And out of hundreds of thousands of such liberated persons, even one person is rarely found who can firmly fix his mind unto the lotus feet of Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna, as declared by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/19.htm">7.19</A>). Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit is specially qualified with the word mah&#257;-man&#257;h, which puts him on an equal level with the mah&#257;tm&#257;s described in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. In the later age also there have been many mah&#257;tm&#257;s of this type, and they also gave up all karma-k&#257;nd&#299;ya conceptions of life' solely and wholly depending on the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. Lord Caitanya, who is Lord Krishna Himself, taught us in His &#346;iksh&#257;shtaka (8):</P><P>&#257;&#347;lishya v&#257; p&#257;da-rat&#257;m pinashtu m&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>adar&#347;an&#257;n marma-hat&#257;m karotu v&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>yath&#257; tath&#257; v&#257; vidadh&#257;tu lampato</P><P CLASS=n>mat-pr&#257;na-n&#257;thas tu sa eva n&#257;parah</P><P>"Lord Krishna, who is the lover of many devotees (women), may embrace this fully surrendered maidservant or may trample me with His feet, or He may render me brokenhearted by not being present before me for a long duration of time, but still He is nothing less than the Absolute Lord of my heart."</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; spoke thus:</P><P>viracaya mayi dandam d&#299;na-bandho day&#257;m&#299; v&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>gatir iha na bhavattah k&#257;cid any&#257; mam&#257;sti</P><P CLASS=n>nipatatu &#347;ata-koti-nirbharam v&#257; nav&#257;mbhah</P><P CLASS=n>tad api kila-payodah st&#363;yate c&#257;takena</P><P>"O Lord of the poor, do what you like with me, give me either mercy or punishment, but in this world I have none to look to except Your Lordship. The c&#257;taka bird always prays for the cloud, regardless of whether it showers rains or throws a thunderbolt."</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la M&#257;dhavendra Pur&#299;, the grand-spiritual master of Lord Caitanya, took leave of all karma-k&#257;nd&#299;ya obligations in the following words:</P><P>sandhy&#257;-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bhoh sn&#257;na tubhyam namo</P><P CLASS=n>bho dev&#257;h pitara&#347; ca tarpana-vidhau n&#257;ham kshamah kshamyat&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>yatra kv&#257;pi nishadya y&#257;dava-kulottamasya kamsa-dvishah</P><P CLASS=n>sm&#257;ram sm&#257;ram agham har&#257;mi tad alam manye kim anyena me</P><P>"O my evening prayer, all good unto you. O my morning bath, I bid you good-bye. O demigods and forefathers, please excuse me. I am unable to perform any more offerings for your pleasure. Now I have decided to free myself from all reactions to sins simply by remembering anywhere and everywhere the great descendant of Yadu and the great enemy of Kamsa [Lord Krishna]. I think that this is sufficient for me. So what is the use of further endeavors?"</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la M&#257;dhavendra Pur&#299; said further:</P><P>mugdham m&#257;m nigadantu n&#299;ti-nipun&#257; bhr&#257;ntam muhur vaidik&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>mandam b&#257;ndhava-sañcay&#257; jada-dhiyam mukt&#257;dar&#257;h sodar&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>unmattam dhanino viveka-catur&#257;h k&#257;mam mah&#257;-d&#257;mbhikam</P><P CLASS=n>moktum na ksh&#257;mate man&#257;g api mano govinda-p&#257;da-sprih&#257;m</P><P>"Let the sharp moralist accuse me of being illusioned; I do not mind. Experts in Vedic activities may slander me as being misled, friends and relatives may call me frustrated, my brothers may call me a fool, the wealthy mammonites may point me out as mad, and the learned philosophers may assert that I am much too proud; still my mind does not budge an inch from the determination to serve the lotus feet of Govinda, though I be unable to do it."</P><P>And also Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said:</P><P>dharm&#257;rtha-k&#257;ma iti yo 'bhihitas trivarga</P><P CLASS=n>&#299;ksh&#257; tray&#299; naya-damau vividh&#257; ca v&#257;rt&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>manye tad etad akhilam nigamasya satyam</P><P CLASS=n>sv&#257;tm&#257;rpanam sva-suhridah paramasya pumsah</P><P>"Religion, economic development and sense gratification are celebrated as three means of attaining the path of salvation. Of these, &#299;ksh&#257; tray&#299; especially, i.e., knowledge of the self, knowledge of fruitive acts and logic and also politics and economics, are different means of livelihood. All these are different subjects of Vedic education, and therefore I consider them temporary engagements. On the other hand, surrendering unto the Supreme Lord Vishnu is a factual gain in life, and I consider it the ultimate truth."
