Without Vedic knowledge, or perfect, infallible knowledge, no one can create anything. All scientific knowledge and perfect knowledge are Vedic. One can get all types of information from the Vedas, and as such, Brahm&#257; was impregnated with all-perfect knowledge so that it was possible for him to create. Thus Brahm&#257; knew the perfect description of creation, as it was exactly apprised to him by the Supreme Lord Hari. Brahm&#257;, on being questioned by N&#257;rada, told N&#257;rada exactly what he had heard directly from the Lord. N&#257;rada again told exactly the same thing to Vy&#257;sa, and Vy&#257;sa also told &#346;ukadeva exactly what he heard from N&#257;rada. And &#346;ukadeva was going to repeat the same statements as he had heard them from Vy&#257;sa. That is the way of Vedic understanding. The language of the Vedas can be revealed only by the above-mentioned disciplic succession, and not otherwise.</P><P>There is no use in theories. Knowledge must be factual. There are many things that are complicated, and one cannot understand them unless they are explained by one who knows. The Vedic knowledge is also very difficult to know and must be learned by the above-mentioned system; otherwise it is not at all understood.</P><P>&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, therefore, prayed for the mercy of the Lord so that he might be able to repeat the very same message that was spoken directly by the Lord to Brahm&#257;, or what was directly spoken by Brahm&#257; to N&#257;rada. Therefore the statements of creation explained by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; are not at all, as the mundaners suggest, theoretical, but are perfectly correct. One who hears these messages and tries to assimilate them gets perfect information of the material creation.</P><P>Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, entitled "The process of Creation."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="../5/1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
