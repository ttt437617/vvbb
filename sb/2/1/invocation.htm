Since by chanting the name of Krishna, V&#257;sudeva, one can achieve all the good results of charity, austerity and penances, it is to be understood that by the chanting of this mantra, om namo bhagavate v&#257;sudev&#257;ya, the author or the speaker or any one of the readers of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is offering respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, Krishna, the reservoir of all pleasure. In the First Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, the principles of creation are described, and thus the First Canto may be called "Creation."</P><P>Similarly, in the Second Canto, the post-creation cosmic manifestation is described. The different planetary systems are described in the Second Canto as different parts of the universal body of the Lord. For this reason, the Second Canto may be called "The Cosmic Manifestation." There are ten chapters in the Second Canto, and in these ten chapters the purpose of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam and the different symptoms of this purpose are narrated. The first chapter describes the glories of chanting, and it hints at the process by which the neophyte devotees may perform meditation on the universal form of the Lord. In the first verse, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; replies to the questions of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit, who asked him about one's duties at the point of death. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit was glad to receive &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and he was proud of being a descendant of Arjuna, the intimate friend of Krishna. personally, he was very humble and meek, but he expressed his gladness that Lord Krishna was very kind to his grandfathers, the sons of P&#257;ndu, especially his own grandfather, Arjuna. And because Lord Krishna was always pleased with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit's family, at the verge of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit's death &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was sent to help him in the process of self-realization. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit was a devotee of Lord Krishna from his childhood, so he had natural affection for Krishna. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; could understand his devotion. Therefore, he welcomed the questions about the King's duty. Because the King hinted that worship of Lord Krishna is the ultimate function of every living entity, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; welcomed the suggestion and said, "Because you have raised questions about Krishna, your question is most glorious."
