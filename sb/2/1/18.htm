The mind too absorbed in material activities can be engaged in the service of the Personality of Godhead and become fixed in full transcendental consciousness.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The first process of spiritualizing the mind by mechanical chanting of the pranava (omk&#257;ra) and by control of the breathing system is technically called the mystic or yogic process of pr&#257;n&#257;y&#257;ma, or fully controlling the breathing air. The ultimate state of this pr&#257;n&#257;y&#257;ma system is to be fixed in trance, technically called sam&#257;dhi. But experience has proven that even the sam&#257;dhi stage also fails to control the materially absorbed mind. For example, the great mystic Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra Muni, even in the stage of samadhi, became a victim of the senses and cohabited with Menak&#257;. History has already recorded this. The mind, although ceasing to think of sensual activities at present, remembers past sensual activities from the subconscious status and thus disturbs one from cent percent engagement in self-realization. Therefore, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; recommends the next step of assured policy, namely to fix one's mind in the service of the Personality of Godhead. Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, also recommends this direct process in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/6/47.htm">6.47</A>). Thus, the mind being spiritually cleansed, one should at once engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord by the different devotional activities of hearing, chanting, etc. If performed under proper guidance, that is the surest path of progress, even for the disturbed mind.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
