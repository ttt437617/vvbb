And the hands, though decorated with glittering bangles, are like those of a dead man if not engaged in the service of the Personality of Godhead Hari.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>SB 2.3.22</B></A>: The eyes which do not look at the symbolic representations of the Personality of Godhead Vishnu [His forms, name, quality, etc.] are like those printed on the plumes of the peacock, and the legs which do not move to the holy places [where the Lord is remembered] are considered to be like tree trunks.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>SB 2.3.23</B></A>: The person who has not at any time received the dust of the feet of the Lord's pure devotee upon his head is certainly a dead body.
