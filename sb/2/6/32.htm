The one is Lord V&#257;sudeva, and only by His different energies and expansions are different manifestations, both in the material and in the spiritual worlds, maintained. In the material world also, Lord V&#257;sudeva is everything, as stated in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/19.htm">7.19</A>). V&#257;sudevah sarvam iti: everything is V&#257;sudeva only. In the Vedic hymns also the same V&#257;sudeva is held to be supreme. It is said in the Vedas, v&#257;sudev&#257;t paro brahman na c&#257;nyo 'rtho 'sti tattvatah: in fact there is no greater truth than V&#257;sudeva. And Lord Krishna affirms the same truth in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/7.htm">7.7</A>). Mattah parataram n&#257;nyat: "There is nothing above Me [Lord Krishna]." So the conception of oneness, as overly stressed by the impersonalist, is also accepted by the personalist devotee of the Lord. The difference is that the impersonalist denies personality in the ultimate issue, whereas the devotee gives more importance to the Personality of Godhead. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam explains this truth in the verse under discussion: Lord V&#257;sudeva is one without a second, but because He is all-powerful, He can expand Himself as well as display His omnipotencies. The Lord is described here as omnipotent by three energies (tri-&#347;akti-dhrik). So primarily His three energies are internal, marginal and external. This external energy is also displayed in the three modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Similarly, the internal potency is also displayed in three spiritual modes &#8212; samvit, sandhin&#299; and hl&#257;din&#299;. The marginal potency, or the living entities, is also spiritual (prakritim viddhi me par&#257;m), but the living entities are never equal to the Lord. The Lord is nirasta-s&#257;mya-ati&#347;aya; in other words, no one is greater than or equal to the Supreme Lord. So the living entities, including even such great personalities as Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva, are all subordinate to the Lord. In the material world also, in His eternal form of Vishnu, He maintains and controls all the affairs of the demigods, including Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
