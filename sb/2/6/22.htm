The Absolute person is the &#299;&#347;vara, or the supreme controller, by His different energies. The ekap&#257;d-vibh&#363;ti manifestation of the material energy of the Lord is just like one of the many mistresses of the Lord, by whom the Lord is not so much attracted, as indicated in the language of the G&#299;t&#257; (bhinn&#257; prakritih). But the region of the trip&#257;d-vibh&#363;ti, being a pure spiritual manifestation of the energy of the Lord, is, so to speak, more attractive to Him. The Lord, therefore, generates the material manifestations by impregnating the material energy, and then, within the manifestation, He expands Himself as the gigantic form of the vi&#347;va-r&#363;pa. The vi&#347;va-r&#363;pa, as it was shown to Arjuna, is not the original form of the Lord. The original form of the Lord is the transcendental form of Purushottama, or Krishna Himself. It is very nicely explained herein that He expands Himself just like the sun. The sun expands itself by its terrible heat and rays, yet the sun is always aloof from such rays and heat. The impersonalist takes into consideration the rays of the Lord without any information of the tangible, transcendental, eternal form of the Lord, known as Krishna. Therefore Krishna, in His supreme personal form, with two hands and flute, is bewildering for the impersonalists who can accommodate only the gigantic vi&#347;va-r&#363;pa of the Lord. They should know that the rays of the sun are secondary to the sun, and similarly the impersonal gigantic form of the Lord is also secondary to the personal form as Purushottama. The Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/37.htm">5.37</A>) confirms this statement as follows:</P><P>&#257;nanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibh&#257;vit&#257;bhis</P><P CLASS=n>t&#257;bhir ya eva nija-r&#363;patay&#257; kal&#257;bhih</P><P CLASS=n>goloka eva nivasaty akhil&#257;tma-bh&#363;to</P><P CLASS=n>govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi</P><P>"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, the one who enlivens the senses of everyone by His personal bodily rays, resides in His transcendental abode, called Goloka. Yet He is present in every nook and corner of His creation by expansion of happy spiritual rays, equal in power to His personal potency of bliss." He is therefore simultaneously personal and impersonal by His inconceivable potency, or He is the one without a second, displaying complete unity in a diversity of material and spiritual manifestations. He is separate from everything, and still nothing is different from Him.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
