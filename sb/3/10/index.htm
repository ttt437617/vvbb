Everything was in his heart, and thus he began to reply to the questions one after another.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 3.10.4</B></A>: The greatly learned sage Maitreya said: O Vidura, Brahm&#257; thus engaged himself in penances for one hundred celestial years, as advised by the Personality of Godhead, and applied himself in devotional service to the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 3.10.5</B></A>: Thereafter Brahm&#257; saw that both the lotus on which he was situated and the water on which the lotus was growing were trembling due to a strong, violent wind.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 3.10.6</B></A>: Long penance and transcendental knowledge of self-realization had matured Brahm&#257; in practical knowledge, and thus he drank the wind completely, along with the water.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 3.10.7</B></A>: Thereafter he saw that the lotus on which he was situated was spread throughout the universe, and he contemplated how to create all the planets, which were previously merged in that very same lotus.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 3.10.8</B></A>: Thus engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Brahm&#257; entered into the whorl of the lotus, and as it spread all over the universe he divided it into three divisions of worlds and later into fourteen divisions.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 3.10.9</B></A>: Lord Brahm&#257; is the most exalted personality in the universe because of his causeless devotional service unto the Lord in mature transcendental knowledge. He therefore created all the fourteen planetary divisions for inhabitation by the different types of living entities.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 3.10.10</B></A>: Vidura inquired from Maitreya: O my lord, O greatly learned sage, kindly describe eternal time, which is another form of the Supreme Lord, the wonderful actor. What are the symptoms of that eternal time? Please describe them to us in detail.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 3.10.11</B></A>: Maitreya said: Eternal time is the primeval source of the interactions of the three modes of material nature. It is unchangeable and limitless, and it works as the instrument of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for His pastimes in the material creation.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 3.10.12</B></A>: This cosmic manifestation is separated from the Supreme Lord as material energy by means of k&#257;la, which is the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Lord.

There are three kinds of annihilations due to eternal time, the material elements and the quality of one's work.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 3.10.15</B></A>: Of the nine creations, the first one is the creation of the mahat-tattva, or the sum total of the material ingredients, wherein the modes interact due to the presence of the Supreme Lord. In the second, the false ego is generated in which the material ingredients, material knowledge and material activities arise.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 3.10.16</B></A>: The sense perceptions are created in the third creation, and from these the elements are generated. The fourth creation is the creation of knowledge and of working capacity.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 3.10.17</B></A>: The fifth creation is that of the controlling deities by the interaction of the mode of goodness, of which the mind is the sum total.

Now hear from me about the creations by Brahm&#257;, who is an incarnation of the mode of passion and who, in the matter of creation, has a brain like that of the Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 3.10.19</B></A>: The seventh creation is that of the immovable entities, which are of six kinds: the fruit trees without flowers, trees and plants which exist until the fruit is ripe, creepers, pipe plants, creepers which have no support, and trees with flowers and fruits.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 3.10.20</B></A>: All the immovable trees and plants seek their subsistence upwards.

In the human race, the mode of passion is very prominent. Humans are always busy in the midst of miserable life, but they think themselves happy in all respects.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>SB 3.10.27</B></A>: O good Vidura, these last three creations and the creation of demigods (the tenth creation) are vaikrita creations, which are different from the previously described pr&#257;krita (natural) creations. The appearance of the Kum&#257;ras is both.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28-29.htm"><B>SB 3.10.28-29</B></A>: The creation of the demigods is of eight varieties: (1) the demigods, (2) the forefathers, (3) the asuras, or demons, (4) the Gandharvas and Apsar&#257;s, or angels, (5) the Yakshas and R&#257;kshasas, (6) the Siddhas, C&#257;ranas and Vidy&#257;dharas, (7) the Bh&#363;tas, Pretas and Pi&#347;&#257;cas, and (8) the superhuman beings, celestial singers, etc. All are created by Brahm&#257;, the creator of the universe.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 3.10.30</B></A>: Now I shall describe the descendants of the Manus.
