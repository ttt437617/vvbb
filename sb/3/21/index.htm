Through many successive births of deep meditation, advanced yog&#299;s aspire to see Your transcendental form.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 3.21.14</B></A>: Your lotus feet are the true vessel to take one across the ocean of mundane nescience. Only persons deprived of their intelligence by the spell of the deluding energy will worship those feet with a view to attain the trivial and momentary pleasures of the senses, which even persons rotting in hell can attain. However, O my Lord, You are so kind that You bestow mercy even upon them.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 3.21.15</B></A>: Therefore, desiring to marry a girl of like disposition who may prove to be a veritable cow of plenty in my married life, to satisfy my lustful desire I too have sought the shelter of Your lotus feet, which are the source of everything, for You are like a desire tree.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 3.21.16</B></A>: O my Lord, You are the master and leader of all living entities. Under Your direction, all conditioned souls, as if bound by rope, are constantly engaged in satisfying their desires. Following them, O embodiment of religion, I also bear oblations for You, who are eternal time.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 3.21.17</B></A>: However, persons who have given up stereotyped worldly affairs and the beastly followers of these affairs, and who have taken shelter of the umbrella of Your lotus feet by drinking the intoxicating nectar of Your qualities and activities in discussions with one another, can be freed from the primary necessities of the material body.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 3.21.18</B></A>: Your wheel, which has three naves, rotates around the axis of the imperishable Brahman. It has thirteen spokes, 360 joints, six rims and numberless leaves carved upon it. Though its revolution cuts short the life-span of the entire creation, this wheel of tremendous velocity cannot touch the life-span of the devotees of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 3.21.19</B></A>: My dear Lord, You alone create the universes. O Personality of Godhead, desiring to create these universes, You create them, maintain them and again wind them up by Your own energies, which are under the control of Your second energy, called yogam&#257;y&#257;, just as a spider creates a cobweb by its own energy and again winds it up.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 3.21.20</B></A>: My dear Lord, although it is not Your desire, You manifest this creation of gross and subtle elements just for our sensual satisfaction.

My dear sir, her parents will come to see you, who are exactly suitable for her, just to deliver their daughter as your wife.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 3.21.28</B></A>: That princess, O holy sage, will be just the type you have been thinking of in your heart for all these long years. She will soon be yours and will serve you to your heart's content.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>SB 3.21.29</B></A>: She will bring forth nine daughters from the seed sown in her by you, and through the daughters you beget, the sages will duly beget children.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 3.21.30</B></A>: With your heart cleansed by properly carrying out My command, resigning to Me the fruits of all your acts, you will finally attain to Me.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 3.21.31</B></A>: Showing compassion to all living entities, you will attain self-realization.

Placing his daughter on it with them, he began traveling all over the earth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>SB 3.21.37</B></A>: O Vidura, they reached the hermitage of the sage, who had just completed his vows of austerity on the very day foretold by the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="38-39.htm"><B>SB 3.21.38-39</B></A>: The holy Lake Bindu-sarovara, flooded by the waters of the River Sarasvat&#299;, was resorted to by hosts of eminent sages. Its holy water was not only auspicious but as sweet as nectar. It was called Bindu-sarovara because drops of tears had fallen there from the eyes of the Lord, who was overwhelmed by extreme compassion for the sage who had sought His protection.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm"><B>SB 3.21.40</B></A>: The shore of the lake was surrounded by clusters of pious trees and creepers, rich in fruits and flowers of all seasons, that afforded shelter to pious animals and birds, which uttered various cries.

Intoxicated bees wandered there, intoxicated peacocks proudly danced, and merry cuckoos called one another.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42-43.htm"><B>SB 3.21.42-43</B></A>: Lake Bindu-sarovara was adorned by flowering trees such as kadamba, campaka, a&#347;oka, karañja, bakula, &#257;sana, kunda, mand&#257;ra, kutaja and young mango trees. The air was filled with the pleasing notes of k&#257;randava ducks, plavas, swans, ospreys, waterfowl, cranes, cakrav&#257;kas and cakoras.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm"><B>SB 3.21.44</B></A>: Its shores abounded with deer, boars, porcupines, gavayas, elephants, baboons, lions, monkeys, mongooses and musk deer.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="45-47.htm"><B>SB 3.21.45-47</B></A>: Entering that most sacred spot with his daughter and going near the sage, the first monarch, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, saw the sage sitting in his hermitage, having just propitiated the sacred fire by pouring oblations into it. His body shone most brilliantly; though he had engaged in austere penance for a long time, he was not emaciated, for the Lord had cast His affectionate sidelong glance upon him and he had also heard the nectar flowing from the moonlike words of the Lord. The sage was tall, his eyes were large, like the petals of a lotus, and he had matted locks on his head. He was clad in rags. Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu approached and saw him to be somewhat soiled, like an unpolished gem.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm"><B>SB 3.21.48</B></A>: Seeing that the monarch had come to his hermitage and was bowing before him, the sage greeted him with benediction and received him with due honor.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm"><B>SB 3.21.49</B></A>: After receiving the sage's attention, the King sat down and was silent.

All obeisances to you, who are none other than Lord Vishnu!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="52-54.htm"><B>SB 3.21.52-54</B></A>: If you did not mount your victorious jeweled chariot, whose mere presence threatens culprits, if you did not produce fierce sounds by the twanging of your bow, and if you did not roam about the world like the brilliant sun, leading a huge army whose trampling feet cause the globe of the earth to tremble, then all the moral laws governing the varnas and &#257;&#347;ramas created by the Lord Himself would be broken by the rogues and rascals.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm"><B>SB 3.21.55</B></A>: If you gave up all thought of the world's situation, unrighteousness would flourish, for men who hanker only after money would be unopposed.
