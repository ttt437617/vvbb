They had storms for their armies and clouds of dust for their ensigns.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 3.17.6</B></A>: The luminaries in the heavens were screened by masses of clouds, in which lightning sometimes flashed as though laughing. Darkness reigned everywhere, and nothing could be seen.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 3.17.7</B></A>: The ocean with its high waves wailed aloud as if stricken with sorrow, and there was a commotion among the creatures inhabiting the ocean.

He feared death at the hands of no one, and there was no checking him. The gods, therefore, were seized with fear at his very sight, and they hid themselves even as snakes hide themselves for fear of Garuda.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>SB 3.17.23</B></A>: On not finding Indra and the other demigods, who had previously been intoxicated with power, the chief of the Daityas, seeing that they had all vanished before his might, roared loudly.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>SB 3.17.24</B></A>: After returning from the heavenly kingdom, the mighty demon, who was like an elephant in wrath, for the sake of sport dived into the deep ocean, which was roaring terribly.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm"><B>SB 3.17.25</B></A>: On his entering the ocean, the aquatic animals who formed the host of Varuna were stricken with fear and ran far away.

There Hirany&#257;ksha fell at Varuna's feet like a lowborn man, and to make fun of him he said with a smile, "Give me battle, O Supreme Lord!"</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 3.17.28</B></A>: You are the guardian of an entire sphere and a ruler of wide fame. Having crushed the might of arrogant and conceited warriors and having conquered all the Daityas and D&#257;navas in the world, you once performed a R&#257;jas&#363;ya sacrifice to the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>SB 3.17.29</B></A>: Thus mocked by an enemy whose vanity knew no bounds, the worshipful lord of the waters waxed angry, but by dint of his reason he managed to curb the anger that had sprung up in him, and he replied: O dear one, we have now desisted from warfare, having grown too old for combat.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 3.17.30</B></A>: You are so skilled in war that I do not see anyone else but the most ancient person, Lord Vishnu, who can give satisfaction in battle to you. Therefore, O chief of the asuras, approach Him, whom even heroes like you mention with praise.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 3.17.31</B></A>: Varuna continued: On reaching Him you will be rid of your pride at once and will lie down on the field of battle, surrounded by dogs, for eternal sleep. It is in order to exterminate wicked fellows like you and to show His grace to the virtuous that He assumes His various incarnations like Var&#257;ha.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
