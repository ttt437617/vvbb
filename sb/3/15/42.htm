My dear demigods, the Lord who thus manifested Himself is worshipable by me, by Lord &#346;iva and by all of you. The sages regarded Him with unsated eyes and joyously bowed their heads at His lotus feet.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The beauty of the Lord was so enchanting that it could not be sufficiently described. The goddess of fortune is supposed to be the most beautiful sight within the spiritual and material creations of the Lord; she has a sense of being the most beautiful, yet her beauty was defeated when the Lord appeared. In other words, the beauty of the goddess of fortune is secondary in the presence of the Lord. In the words of Vaishnava poets, it is said that the Lord's beauty is so enchanting that it defeats hundreds of thousands of Cupids. He is therefore called Madana-mohana. It is also described that the Lord sometimes becomes mad after the beauty of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;. Poets describe that under those circumstances, although Lord Krishna is Madana-mohana, He becomes Madana-d&#257;ha, or enchanted by the beauty of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;. Actually the Lord's beauty is superexcellent, surpassing even the beauty of Lakshm&#299; in Vaikuntha. The devotees of the Lord in the Vaikuntha planets want to see the Lord as the most beautiful, but the devotees in Gokula or Krishnaloka want to see R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299; as more beautiful than Krishna. The adjustment is that the Lord, being bhakta-vatsala, or one who wants to please His devotees, assumes such features so that devotees like Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva and other demigods may be pleased. Here also, for the devotee-sages, the Kum&#257;ras, the Lord appeared in His most beautiful feature, and they continued to see Him without satiation and wanted to continue seeing Him more and more.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
