The life of Emperor Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, however, was not tasteless; as he grew older, his life remained as fresh as in the beginning because of his continued Krishna consciousness. The life of a man in Krishna consciousness is always fresh. It is said that the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening and its business is to reduce the duration of everyone's life. But the sunrise and sunset cannot diminish the life of one who engages in Krishna consciousness. Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu's life did not become stale after some time, for he engaged himself always in chanting about and meditating upon Lord Vishnu. He was the greatest yog&#299; because he never wasted his time. It is especially mentioned here, vishnoh kurvato bruvatah kath&#257;h. When he talked, he talked only of Krishna and Vishnu, the Personality of Godhead; when he heard something, it was about Krishna; when he meditated, it was upon Krishna and His activities.</P><P>It is stated that his life was very long, seventy-one yugas. One yuga is completed in 4,320,000 years, seventy-one of such yugas is the duration of the life of a Manu, and fourteen such Manus come and go in one day of Brahma. For the entire duration of his life - 4,320,000 x 71 years &#8212; Manu engaged in Krishna consciousness by chanting, hearing, talking about and meditating upon Krishna. Therefore, his life was not wasted, nor did it become stale.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
