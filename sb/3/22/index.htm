Hence the br&#257;hmanas are said to be His heart and the kshatriyas His arms.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 3.22.4</B></A>: That is why the br&#257;hmanas and kshatriyas protect each other, as well as themselves; and the Lord Himself, who is both the cause and effect and is yet immutable, protects them through each other.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 3.22.5</B></A>: Now I have resolved all my doubts simply by meeting you, for Your Lordship has very kindly and clearly explained the duty of a king who desires to protect his subjects.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 3.22.6</B></A>: It is my good fortune that I have been able to see you, for you cannot easily be seen by persons who have not subdued the mind or controlled the senses. I am all the more fortunate to have touched with my head the blessed dust of your feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 3.22.7</B></A>: I have fortunately been instructed by you, and thus great favor has been bestowed upon me. I thank God that I have listened with open ears to your pure words.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 3.22.8</B></A>: O great sage, graciously be pleased to listen to the prayer of my humble self, for my mind is troubled by affection for my daughter.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 3.22.9</B></A>: My daughter is the sister of Priyavrata and Utt&#257;nap&#257;da.

She is so beautiful that by her bodily luster alone she excels the beauty of her ornaments.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 3.22.17</B></A>: I have heard that Vi&#347;v&#257;vasu, the great Gandharva, his mind stupefied with infatuation, fell from his airplane after seeing your daughter playing with a ball on the roof of the palace, for she was indeed beautiful with her tinkling ankle bells and her eyes moving to and fro.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 3.22.18</B></A>: What wise man would not welcome her, the very ornament of womanhood, the beloved daughter of Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu and sister of Utt&#257;nap&#257;da? Those who have not worshiped the gracious feet of the goddess of fortune cannot even perceive her, yet she has come of her own accord to seek my hand.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 3.22.19</B></A>: Therefore I shall accept this chaste girl as my wife, on the condition that after she bears semen from my body, I shall accept the life of devotional service accepted by the most perfect human beings. That process was described by Lord Vishnu. It is free from envy.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 3.22.20</B></A>: The highest authority for me is the unlimited Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whom this wonderful creation emanates and in whom its sustenance and dissolution rest.

My dear daughter!"</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26-27.htm"><B>SB 3.22.26-27</B></A>: After asking and obtaining the great sage's permission to leave, the monarch mounted his chariot with his wife and started for his capital, followed by his retinue. Along the way he saw the prosperity of the tranquil seers' beautiful hermitages on both the charming banks of the Sarasvat&#299;, the river so agreeable to saintly persons.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 3.22.28</B></A>: Overjoyed to know of his arrival, his subjects came forth from Brahm&#257;varta to greet their returning lord with songs, prayers and musical instruments.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29-30.htm"><B>SB 3.22.29-30</B></A>: The city of Barhishmat&#299;, rich in all kinds of wealth, was so called because Lord Vishnu's hair dropped there from His body when He manifested Himself as Lord Boar. As He shook His body, this very hair fell and turned into blades of evergreen ku&#347;a grass and k&#257;&#347;a [another kind of grass used for mats], by means of which the sages worshiped Lord Vishnu after defeating the demons who had interfered with the performance of their sacrifices.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 3.22.31</B></A>: Manu spread a seat of ku&#347;as and k&#257;&#347;as and worshiped the Lord, the Personality of Godhead, by whose grace he had obtained the rule of the terrestrial globe.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>SB 3.22.32</B></A>: Having entered the city of Barhishmat&#299;, in which he had previously lived, Manu entered his palace, which was filled with an atmosphere that eradicated the three miseries of material existence.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>SB 3.22.33</B></A>: Emperor Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu enjoyed life with his wife and subjects and fulfilled his desires without being disturbed by unwanted principles contrary to the process of religion. Celestial musicians and their wives sang in chorus about the pure reputation of the Emperor, and early in the morning, every day, he used to listen to the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a loving heart.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>SB 3.22.34</B></A>: Thus Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu was a saintly king. Although absorbed in material happiness, he was not dragged to the lowest grade of life, for he always enjoyed his material happiness in a Krishna conscious atmosphere.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm"><B>SB 3.22.35</B></A>: Consequently, although his duration of life gradually came to an end, his long life, consisting of a Manvantara era, was not spent in vain, since he ever engaged in hearing, contemplating, writing down and chanting the pastimes of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>SB 3.22.36</B></A>: He passed his time, which lasted seventy-one cycles of the four ages [71 x 4,320,000 years], always thinking of V&#257;sudeva and always engaged in matters regarding V&#257;sudeva. Thus he transcended the three destinations.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>SB 3.22.37</B></A>: Therefore, O Vidura, how can persons completely under the shelter of Lord Krishna in devotional service be put into miseries pertaining to the body, the mind, nature, and other men and living creatures?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm"><B>SB 3.22.38</B></A>: In reply to questions asked by certain sages, he [Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu], out of compassion for all living entities, taught the diverse sacred duties of men in general and the different varnas and &#257;&#347;ramas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm"><B>SB 3.22.39</B></A>: I have spoken to you of the wonderful character of Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, the original king, whose reputation is worthy of description.
