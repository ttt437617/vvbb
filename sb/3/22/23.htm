The gifts are given according to the position of the father of the bride. P&#257;ribarh&#257;n mah&#257;-dhan&#257;n means the dowry which must be awarded to the bridegroom at the time of marriage. Here mah&#257;-dhan&#257;n means greatly valuable gifts befitting the dowry of an empress. The words bh&#363;sh&#257;-v&#257;sah paricchad&#257;n also appear here. Bh&#363;sh&#257; means "ornaments," v&#257;sah means "clothing," and paricchad&#257;n means "various household articles." All things befitting the marriage ceremony of an emperor's daughter were awarded to Kardama Muni, who was until now observing celibacy as a brahmac&#257;r&#299;. The bride, Devah&#363;ti, was very richly dressed with ornaments and clothing.</P><P>In this way Kardama Muni was married with full opulence to a qualified wife and was endowed with the necessary paraphernalia for household life. In the Vedic way of marriage such a dowry is still given to the bridegroom by the father of the bride; even in poverty-stricken India there are marriages where hundreds and thousands of rupees are spent for a dowry. The dowry system is not illegal, as some have tried to prove. The dowry is a gift given to the daughter by the father to show good will, and it is compulsory. In rare cases where the father is completely unable to give a dowry, it is enjoined that he must at least give a fruit and a flower. As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, God can also be pleased even by a fruit and a flower. When there is financial inability and no question of accumulating a dowry by another means, one can give a fruit and flower for the satisfaction of the bridegroom.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
