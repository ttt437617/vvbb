As stated in the Vedic scriptures, the first-class process is to call the bridegroom to the home of the bride and hand her to him in charity with a dowry of necessary ornaments, gold, furniture and other household paraphernalia. This form of marriage is prevalent among higher-class Hindus even today and is declared in the &#347;&#257;stras to confer great religious merit on the bride's father. To give a daughter in charity to a suitable son-in-law is considered to be one of the pious activities of a householder. There are eight forms of marriage mentioned in the scripture Manu-smriti, but only one process of marriage, br&#257;hma or r&#257;jasika marriage, is now current. Other kinds of marriage &#8212; by love, by exchange of garlands or by kidnapping the bride &#8212; are now forbidden in this Kali age. Formerly, kshatriyas would, at their pleasure, kidnap a princess from another royal house, and there would he a fight between the kshatriya and the girl's family; then, if the kidnapper was the winner, the girl would be offered to him for marriage. Even Krishna married Rukmin&#299; by that process, and some of His sons and grandsons also married by kidnapping. Krishna's grandsons kidnapped Duryodhana's daughter, which caused a fight between the Kuru and Yadu families. Afterward, an adjustment was made by the elderly members of the Kuru family. Such marriages were current in bygone ages, but at the present moment they are impossible because the strict principles of kshatriya life have practically been abolished. Since India has become dependent on foreign countries, the particular influences of her social orders have been lost; now, according to the scriptures, everyone is a &#347;&#363;dra. The so-called br&#257;hmanas, kshatriyas and vai&#347;yas have forgotten their traditional activities, and in the absence of these activities they are called &#347;&#363;dras. It is said in the scriptures, kalau &#347;&#363;dra-sambhavah. In the age of Kali everyone will be like &#347;&#363;dras. The traditional social customs are not followed in this age, although formerly they were followed strictly.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
