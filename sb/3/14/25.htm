His hair is dusty from the whirlwind dust of the burning crematorium. He is the younger brother of your husband, and he sees with his three eyes.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Lord &#346;iva is not an ordinary living entity, nor is he in the category of Vishnu, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is far more powerful than any living entity up to the standard of Brahm&#257;, yet he is not on an equal level with Vishnu. Since he is almost like Lord Vishnu, &#346;iva can see past, present and future. One of his eyes is like the sun, another is like the moon, and his third eye, which is between his eyebrows, is like fire. He can generate fire from his middle eye, and he is able to vanquish any powerful living entity, including Brahm&#257;, yet he does not live pompously in a nice house, etc., nor does he possess any material properties, although he is master of the material world. He lives mostly in the crematorium, where dead bodies are burnt, and the whirlwind dust of the crematorium is his bodily dress. He is unstained by material contamination. Ka&#347;yapa took him as his younger brother because the youngest sister of Diti (Ka&#347;yapa's wife) was married to Lord &#346;iva. The husband of one's sister is considered one's brother. By that social relationship, Lord &#346;iva happened to be the younger brother of Ka&#347;yapa. Ka&#347;yapa warned his wife that because Lord &#346;iva would see their sex indulgence, the time was not appropriate. Diti might argue that they would enjoy sex life in a private place, but Ka&#347;yapa reminded her that Lord &#346;iva has three eyes, called the sun, moon and fire, and one cannot escape his vigilance any more than one can escape Vishnu. Although seen by the police, a criminal is sometimes not immediately punished; the police wait for the proper time to apprehend him. The forbidden time for sexual intercourse would be noted by Lord &#346;iva, and Diti would meet with proper punishment by giving birth to a child of ghostly character or a godless impersonalist. Ka&#347;yapa foresaw this, and thus he warned his wife Diti.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
