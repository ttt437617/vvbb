As soon as he was asked about the message of the Lord, he at once remembered all about Him.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 3.2.4</B></A>: For a moment he remained dead silent, and his body did not move. He became absorbed in the nectar of remembering the Lord's lotus feet in devotional ecstasy, and he appeared to be going increasingly deeper into that ecstasy.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 3.2.5</B></A>: It was so observed by Vidura that Uddhava had all the transcendental bodily changes due to total ecstasy, and he was trying to wipe away tears of separation from his eyes. Thus Vidura could understand that Uddhava had completely assimilated extensive love for the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 3.2.6</B></A>: The great devotee Uddhava soon came back from the abode of the Lord to the human plane, and wiping his eyes, he awakened his reminiscence of the past and spoke to Vidura in a pleasing mood.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 3.2.7</B></A>: &#346;r&#299; Uddhava said: My dear Vidura, the sun of the world, Lord Krishna, has set, and our house has now been swallowed by the great snake of time. What can I say to you about our welfare?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 3.2.8</B></A>: This universe with all its planets is most unfortunate. And even more unfortunate are the members of the Yadu dynasty because they could not identify Lord Hari as the Personality of Godhead, any more than the fish could identify the moon.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 3.2.9</B></A>: The Yadus were all experienced devotees, learned and expert in psychic study. Over and above this, they were always with the Lord in all kinds of relaxations, and still they were only able to know Him as the one Supreme who dwells everywhere.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 3.2.10</B></A>: Under no circumstances can the words of persons bewildered by the illusory energy of the Lord deviate the intelligence of those who are completely surrendered souls.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 3.2.11</B></A>: Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna, who manifested His eternal form before the vision of all on the earth, performed His disappearance by removing His form from the sight of those who were unable to see Him [as He is] due to not executing required penance.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 3.2.12</B></A>: The Lord appeared in the mortal world by His internal potency, yoga-m&#257;y&#257;. He came in His eternal form, which is just suitable for His pastimes. These pastimes were wonderful for everyone, even for those proud of their own opulence, including the Lord Himself in His form as the Lord of Vaikuntha. Thus His [&#346;r&#299; Krishna's] transcendental body is the ornament of all ornaments.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 3.2.13</B></A>: All the demigods from the upper, lower and middle universal planetary systems assembled at the altar of the r&#257;jas&#363;ya sacrifice performed by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira. After seeing the beautiful bodily features of Lord Krishna, they all contemplated that He was the ultimate dexterous creation of Brahm&#257;, the creator of human beings.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 3.2.14</B></A>: The damsels of Vraja, after pastimes of laughter, humor and exchanges of glances, were anguished when Krishna left them. They used to follow Him with their eyes, and thus they sat down with stunned intelligence and could not finish their household duties.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 3.2.15</B></A>: The Personality of Godhead, the all-compassionate controller of both the spiritual and material creations, is unborn, but when there is friction between His peaceful devotees and persons who are in the material modes of nature, He takes birth just like fire, accompanied by the mahat-tattva.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 3.2.16</B></A>: When I think of Lord Krishna &#8212; how He was born in the prison house of Vasudeva although He is unborn, how He went away from His father's protection to Vraja and lived there incognito out of fear of the enemy, and how, although unlimitedly powerful, He fled from Mathur&#257; in fear &#8212; all these bewildering incidents give me distress.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 3.2.17</B></A>: Lord Krishna begged pardon from His parents for Their [Krishna's and Balar&#257;ma's] inability to serve their feet, due to being away from home because of great fear of Kamsa. He said, "O mother, O father, please excuse Us for this inability." All this behavior of the Lord gives me pain at heart.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 3.2.18</B></A>: Who, after smelling the dust of His lotus feet even once, could ever forget it? Simply by expanding the leaves of His eyebrows, Krishna has given the deathblow to those who were burdening the earth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 3.2.19</B></A>: You have personally seen how the King of Cedi [&#346;i&#347;up&#257;la] achieved success in yoga practice, although he hated Lord Krishna. Even the actual yog&#299;s aspire after such success with great interest by performance of their various practices. Who can tolerate separation from Him?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 3.2.20</B></A>: Certainly others who were fighters on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra were purified by the onslaught of Arjuna's arrows, and while seeing the lotuslike face of Krishna, so pleasing to the eyes, they achieved the abode of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>SB 3.2.21</B></A>: Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna is the Lord of all kinds of threes and is independently supreme by achievement of all kinds of fortune. He is worshiped by the eternal maintainers of the creation, who offer Him the paraphernalia of worship by touching their millions of helmets to His feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>SB 3.2.22</B></A>: Therefore, O Vidura, does it not pain us, His servitors, when we remember that He [Lord Krishna] used to stand before King Ugrasena, who was sitting on the royal throne, and used to submit explanations before him, saying, "O My lord, please let it be known to you"?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>SB 3.2.23</B></A>: Alas, how shall I take shelter of one more merciful than He who granted the position of mother to a she-demon [P&#363;tan&#257;] although she was unfaithful and she prepared deadly poison to be sucked from her breast?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>SB 3.2.24</B></A>: I consider the demons, who are inimical toward the Lord, to be more than the devotees because while fighting with the Lord, absorbed in thoughts of enmity, they are able to see the Lord carried on the shoulder of Garuda, the son of T&#257;rkshya [Ka&#347;yapa], and carrying the wheel weapon in His hand.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm"><B>SB 3.2.25</B></A>: The Personality of Godhead, Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna, being prayed to by Brahm&#257; to bring welfare to the earth, was begotten by Vasudeva in the womb of his wife Devak&#299; in the prison of the King of Bhoja.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>SB 3.2.26</B></A>: Thereafter, His father, being afraid of Kamsa, brought Him to the cow pastures of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nanda, and there He lived for eleven years like a covered flame with His elder brother, Baladeva.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>SB 3.2.27</B></A>: In His childhood, the Almighty Lord was surrounded by cowherd boys and calves, and thus He traveled on the shore of the Yamun&#257; River, through gardens densely covered with trees and filled with vibrations of chirping birds.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 3.2.28</B></A>: When the Lord displayed His activities just suitable for childhood, He was visible only to the residents of Vrind&#257;vana. Sometimes He would cry and sometimes laugh, just like a child, and while so doing He would appear like a lion cub.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>SB 3.2.29</B></A>: While herding the very beautiful bulls, the Lord, who was the reservoir of all opulence and fortune, used to blow His flute, and thus He enlivened His faithful followers, the cowherd boys.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 3.2.30</B></A>: The great wizards who were able to assume any form were engaged by the King of Bhoja, Kamsa, to kill Krishna, but in the course of His pastimes the Lord killed them as easily as a child breaks dolls.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 3.2.31</B></A>: The inhabitants of Vrind&#257;vana were perplexed by great difficulties because a certain portion of the Yamun&#257; was poisoned by the chief of the reptiles [K&#257;liya]. The Lord chastised the snake-king within the water and drove him away, and after coming out of the river, He caused the cows to drink the water and proved that the water was again in its natural state.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>SB 3.2.32</B></A>: The Supreme Lord, Krishna, desired to utilize the opulent financial strength of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nanda for worship of the cows, and also He wanted to give a lesson to Indra, the King of heaven. Thus He advised His father to perform worship of go, or the pasturing land and the cows, with the help of learned br&#257;hmanas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>SB 3.2.33</B></A>: O sober Vidura, King Indra, his honor having been insulted, poured water incessantly on Vrind&#257;vana, and thus the inhabitants of Vraja, the land of cows, were greatly distressed. But the compassionate Lord Krishna saved them from danger with His pastime umbrella, the Govardhana Hill.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>SB 3.2.34</B></A>: In the third season of the year, the Lord enjoyed as the central beauty of the assembly of women by attracting them with His pleasing songs in an autumn night brightened by moonshine.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
