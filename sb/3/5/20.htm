You were begotten by the son of Satyavat&#299;, Vy&#257;sadeva, in the kept wife of his brother.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>M&#257;ndavya Muni was a great sage (cf. Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/13/1.htm">1.13.1</A>), and Vidura was formerly the controller Yamar&#257;ja, who takes charge of the living entities after death. Birth, maintenance and death are three conditional states of the living entities who are within the material world. As the appointed controller after death, Yamar&#257;ja once tried M&#257;ndavya Muni for his childhood profligacy and ordered him to be pierced with a lance. M&#257;ndavya, being angry at Yamar&#257;ja for awarding him undue punishment, cursed him to become a &#347;&#363;dra (member of the less intelligent laborer class). Thus Yamar&#257;ja took birth in the womb of the kept wife of Vicitrav&#299;rya from the semen of Vicitrav&#299;rya's brother, Vy&#257;sadeva. Vy&#257;sadeva is the son of Satyavat&#299; by the great King &#346;&#257;ntanu, the father of Bh&#299;shmadeva. This mysterious history of Vidura was known to Maitreya Muni because he happened to be a contemporary friend of Vy&#257;sadeva's. In spite of Vidura's birth from the womb of a kept wife, because he had otherwise high parentage and great connection he inherited the highest talent of becoming a great devotee of the Lord. To take birth in such a great family is understood to be an advantage for attaining devotional life. Vidura was given this chance due to his previous greatness.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
