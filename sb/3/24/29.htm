In other words, devotional service to the Lord is so easy that even a householder can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as one of the members of his household, as his son, as Kardama Muni experienced. He was a householder, although a yog&#299;, but he had the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapila Muni as his son.</P><P>Devotional service is such a powerful transcendental method that it surpasses all other methods of transcendental realization. The Lord says, therefore, that He lives neither in Vaikuntha nor in the heart of a yog&#299;, but He lives where His pure devotees are always chanting and glorifying Him. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as bhakta-vatsala. He is never described as jñ&#257;n&#299;-vatsala or yog&#299;-vatsala. He is always described as bhakta-vatsala because He is more inclined toward His devotees than toward other transcendentalists. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; it is confirmed that only a devotee can understand Him as He is. Bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/55.htm">Bg. 18.55</A>] "One can understand Me only by devotional service, not otherwise." That understanding alone is real because although jñ&#257;n&#299;s, mental speculators, can realize only the effulgence, or the bodily luster, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and yog&#299;s can realize only the partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a bhakta not only realizes Him as He is but also associates with the Personality of Godhead face to face.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
