O Muni, because I told you before that I would become your son, I have descended to fulfill this truth.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Kardama Muni was to leave his family life to completely engage in the service of the Lord. But since he knew that the Lord Himself, as Kapila, had taken birth in his home as his own son, why was he preparing to leave home to search out self-realization or God realization? God Himself was present in his home &#8212; why should he leave home? Such a question may certainly arise. But here it is said that whatever is spoken in the Vedas and whatever is practiced in accordance with the injunctions of the Vedas is to be accepted as authoritative in society. Vedic authority says that a householder must leave home after his fiftieth year. Pañc&#257;&#347;ordhvam vanam vrajet: one must leave his family life and enter the forest after the age of fifty. This is an authoritative statement of the Vedas, based on the division of social life into four departments of activity &#8212; brahmacarya, grihastha, v&#257;naprastha and sanny&#257;sa.</P><P>Kardama Muni practiced yoga very rigidly as a brahmac&#257;r&#299; before his marriage, and he became so powerful and attained so much mystic power that his father, Brahm&#257;, ordered him to marry and beget children as a householder. Kardama did that also; he begot nine good daughters and one son, Kapila Muni, and thus his householder duty was also performed nicely, and now his duty was to leave. Even though he had the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his son, he had to respect the authority of the Vedas. This is a very important lesson. Even if one has God in his home as his son, one should still follow the Vedic injunctions. It is stated, mah&#257;jano yena gatah sa panth&#257;h: one should traverse the path which is followed by great personalities.</P><P>Kardama Muni's example is very instructive, for in spite of having the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his son, he left home just to obey the authority of the Vedic injunction. Kardama Muni states here the main purpose of his leaving home: while traveling all over the world as a mendicant, he would always remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart and thereby be freed from all the anxieties of material existence. In this age of Kali-yuga sanny&#257;sa is prohibited because persons in this age are all &#347;&#363;dras and cannot follow the rules and regulations of sanny&#257;sa life. It is very commonly found that so-called sanny&#257;s&#299;s are addicted to nonsense &#8212; even to having private relationships with women. This is the abominable situation in this age. Although they dress themselves as sanny&#257;s&#299;s, they still cannot free themselves from the four principles of sinful life, namely illicit sex life, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Since they are not freed from these four principles, they are cheating the public by posing as sv&#257;m&#299;s.</P><P>In Kali-yuga the injunction is that no one should accept sanny&#257;sa. Of course, those who actually follow the rules and regulations must take sanny&#257;sa. Generally, however, people are unable to accept sanny&#257;sa life, and therefore Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu stressed, kalau n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva na-sty eva gatir anyath&#257;. In this age there is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative than to chant the holy name of the Lord: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. The main purpose of sanny&#257;sa life is to be in constant companionship with the Supreme Lord, either by thinking of Him within the heart or hearing of Him through aural reception. In this age, hearing is more important than thinking because one's thinking may be disturbed by mental agitation, but if one concentrates on hearing, he will be forced to associate with the sound vibration of Krishna. Krishna and the sound vibration "Krishna" are nondifferent, so if one loudly vibrates Hare Krishna, he will be able to think of Krishna immediately. This process of chanting is the best process of self-realization in this age; therefore Lord Caitanya preached it so nicely for the benefit of all humanity.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
