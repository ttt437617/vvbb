He appears in three yugas &#8212; Satya, Tret&#257; and Dv&#257;para &#8212; but in Kali-yuga He does not appear. From the prayers of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, however, we understand that He appears garbed as a devotee in Kali-yuga. Lord Caitanya is that devotee. Krishna appeared in the form of a devotee, but although He never disclosed Himself, R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; could understand His identity, for the Lord cannot hide Himself from a pure devotee. R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; detected Him when he offered his first obeisances to Lord Caitanya. He knew that Lord Caitanya was Krishna Himself and therefore offered his obeisances with the following words: "I offer my respects to Krishna, who has now appeared as Lord Caitanya." This is also confirmed in the prayers of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja: in Kali-yuga He does not directly appear, but He appears as a devotee. Vishnu, therefore, is known as tri-yuga. Another explanation of tri-yuga is that He has three pairs of divine attributes, namely power and affluence, piety and renown, and wisdom and dispassion. According to &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;, His three pairs of opulences are complete riches and complete strength, complete fame and complete beauty, and complete wisdom and complete renunciation. There are different interpretations of tri-yuga, but it is accepted by all learned scholars that tri-yuga means Vishnu. When Kardama Muni understood that his son, Kapila, was Vishnu Himself, he wanted to offer his obeisances. Therefore, when Kapila was alone he offered his respects and expressed his mind as follows.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
