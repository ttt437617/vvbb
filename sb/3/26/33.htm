Therefore the Vedic knowledge, which is known as &#347;ruti, or that which is received by hearing, is also called apaurusha. Apaurusha means "not spoken by any person materially created." It is stated in the beginning of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, tene brahma hrid&#257;. The sound of Brahman, or Veda, was first impregnated into the heart of Brahm&#257;, the original learned man (&#257;di-kavaye). How did he become learned? Whenever there is learning, there must be a speaker and the process of hearing. But Brahm&#257; was the first created being. Who spoke to him? Since no one was there, who was the spiritual master to give knowledge? He was the only living creature; therefore the Vedic knowledge was imparted within his heart by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated within everyone as Param&#257;tm&#257;. Vedic knowledge is understood to be spoken by the Supreme Lord, and therefore it is free from the defects of material understanding. Material understanding is defective. If we hear something from a conditioned soul, it is full of defects. All material and mundane information is tainted by illusion, error, cheating and imperfection of the senses. Because Vedic knowledge was imparted by the Supreme Lord, who is transcendental to material creation, it is perfect. If we receive that Vedic knowledge from Brahm&#257; in disciplic succession, then we receive perfect knowledge.</P><P>Every word we hear has a meaning behind it. As soon as we hear the word "water," there is a substance &#8212; water &#8212; behind the word. Similarly, as soon as we hear the word "God," there is a meaning to it. If we receive that meaning and explanation of "God" from God Himself, then it is perfect. But if we speculate about the meaning of "God," it is imperfect. Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, which is the science of God, is spoken by the Personality of Godhead Himself. This is perfect knowledge. Mental speculators or so-called philosophers who are researching what is actually God will never understand the nature of God. The science of God has to be understood in disciplic succession from Brahm&#257;, who was first instructed about knowledge of God by God Himself. We can understand the knowledge of God by hearing Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; from a person authorized in the disciplic succession.</P><P>When we speak of seeing, there must be form. By our sense perception, the beginning experience is the sky. Sky is the beginning of form. And from the sky, other forms emanate. The objects of knowledge and sense perception begin, therefore, from the sky.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
