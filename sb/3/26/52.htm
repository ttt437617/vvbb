Its layers of water, air, fire, sky, ego and mahat-tattva increase in thickness one after another. Each layer is ten times bigger than the previous one, and the final outside layer is covered by pradh&#257;na. Within this egg is the universal form of Lord Hari, of whose body the fourteen planetary systems are parts.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>This universe, or the universal sky which we can visualize with its innumerable planets, is shaped just like an egg. As an egg is covered by a shell, the universe is also covered by various layers. The first layer is water, the next is fire, then air, then sky, and the ultimate holding crust is pradh&#257;na. Within this egglike universe is the universal form of the Lord as the vir&#257;t-purusha. All the different planetary situations are parts of His body. This is already explained in the beginning of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, Second Canto. The planetary systems are considered to form different bodily parts of that universal form of the Lord. Persons who cannot directly engage in the worship of the transcendental form of the Lord are advised to think of and worship this universal form. The lowest planetary system, P&#257;t&#257;la, is considered to be the sole of the Supreme Lord, and the earth is considered to be the belly of the Lord. Brahmaloka, or the highest planetary system, where Brahm&#257; lives, is considered to be the head of the Lord.</P><P>This vir&#257;t-purusha is considered an incarnation of the Lord. The original form of the Lord is Krishna, as confirmed in Brahma-samhit&#257;: &#257;di-purusha. The vir&#257;t-purusha is also purusha, but He is not &#257;di-purusha. The &#257;di-purusha is Krishna. &#298;&#347;varah paramah krishnah sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigrahah/ an&#257;dir &#257;dir govindah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>]. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; Krishna is also accepted as the &#257;di-purusha, the original. Krishna says, "No one is greater than I." There are innumerable expansions of the Lord, and all of them are purushas, or enjoyers, but neither the vir&#257;t-purusha nor the purusha-avat&#257;ras &#8212; K&#257;ranodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu, Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu and Ksh&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu &#8212; nor any of the many other expansions, is the original. In each universe there are Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu, the vir&#257;t-purusha and Ksh&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu. The active manifestation of the vir&#257;t-purusha is described here. persons who are in the lower grade of understanding regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead may think of the universal form of the Lord, for that is advised in the Bh&#257;gavatam.</P><P>The dimensions of the universe are estimated here. The outer covering is made of layers of water, air, fire, sky, ego and mahat-tattva, and each layer is ten times greater than the one previous. The space within the hollow of the universe cannot be measured by any human scientist or anyone else, and beyond the hollow there are seven coverings, each one ten times greater than the one preceding it. The layer of water is ten times greater than the diameter of the universe, and the layer of fire is ten times greater than that of water. Similarly, the layer of air is ten times greater than that of fire. These dimensions are all inconceivable to the tiny brain of a human being.</P><P>It is also stated that this description is of only one egglike universe. There are innumerable universes besides this one, and some of them are many, many times greater. It is considered, in fact, that this universe is the smallest; therefore the predominating superintendent, or Brahm&#257;, has only four heads for management. In other universes, which are far greater than this one, Brahm&#257; has more heads. In the Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita it is stated that all these Brahm&#257;s were called one day by Lord Krishna on the inquiry of the small Brahm&#257;, who, after seeing all the larger Brahm&#257;s, was thunderstruck. That is the inconceivable potency of the Lord. No one can measure the length and breadth of God by speculation or by false identification with God. These attempts are symptoms of lunacy.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="53.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
