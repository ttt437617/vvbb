His very glance was luminous, and He scattered the clouds in the sky with His hooves and His glittering white tusks.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>When the Lord is offered prayers by His devotees, His transcendental activities are described. Here are some of the transcendental features of Lord Boar. As the residents of the upper three planetary systems offered their prayers to the Lord, it is understood that His body expanded throughout the sky, beginning from the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, or Satyaloka. It is stated in the Brahma-samhit&#257; that His eyes are the sun and the moon; therefore His very glance over the sky was as illuminating as the sun or the moon. The Lord is described herein as mah&#299;dhrah, which means either a "big mountain" or the "sustainer of the earth." In other words, the Lord's body was as big and hard as the Himalayan Mountains; otherwise how was it possible that He kept the entire earth on the support of His white tusks? The poet Jayadeva, a great devotee of the Lord, has sung of the incident in his prayers for the incarnations:</P><P>vasati da&#347;ana-&#347;ikhare dharan&#299; tava lagn&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;a&#347;ini kala&#324;ka-kaleva nimagn&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>ke&#347;ava dhrita-&#347;&#363;kara-r&#363;pa jaya jagad&#299;&#347;a hare</P><P>"All glories to Lord Ke&#347;ava [Krishna], who appeared as the boar.
