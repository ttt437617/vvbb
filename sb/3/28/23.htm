She can always be found massaging the legs and thighs of the transcendental Lord, very carefully serving Him in this way.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Brahm&#257; is the appointed lord of the universe. Because his father is Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu, Lakshm&#299;, the goddess of fortune, is automatically his mother. Lakshm&#299;j&#299; is worshiped by all demigods and by the inhabitants of other planets as well. Human beings are also eager to receive favor from the goddess of fortune. Lakshm&#299; is always engaged in massaging the legs and thighs of the Supreme Personality of Godhead N&#257;r&#257;yana, who is lying on the ocean of Garbha within the universe. Brahm&#257; is described here as the son of the goddess of fortune, but actually he was not born of her womb. Brahm&#257; takes his birth from the abdomen of the Lord Himself. A lotus flower grows from the abdomen of Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu, and Brahm&#257; is born there. Therefore Lakshm&#299;j&#299;'s massaging of the thighs of the Lord should not be taken as the behavior of an ordinary wife. The Lord is transcendental to the behavior of the ordinary male and female. The word abhavasya is very significant, for it indicates that He could produce Brahm&#257; without the assistance of the goddess of fortune.</P><P>Since transcendental behavior is different from mundane behavior, it should not be taken that the Lord receives service from His wife just as a demigod or human being might receive service from his wife. It is advised here that the yog&#299; always keep this picture in his heart. The devotee always thinks of this relationship between Lakshm&#299; and N&#257;r&#257;yana; therefore he does not meditate on the mental plane as impersonalists and voidists do.</P><P>Bhava means "one who accepts a material body," and abhava means "one who does not accept a material body but descends in the original, spiritual body." Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana is not born of anything material. Matter is generated from matter, but He is not born of matter. Brahm&#257; is born after the creation, but since the Lord existed before the creation, the Lord has no material body.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
