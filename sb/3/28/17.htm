He is ever youthful and always eager to bestow His blessing upon His devotees.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The word sarva-loka-namaskritam means that He is worshipable by everyone on every planet. There are innumerable planets in the material world and innumerable planets in the spiritual world as well. On each planet there are innumerable inhabitants who worship the Lord, for the Lord is worshipable by all but the impersonalists. The Supreme Lord is very beautiful. The word &#347;a&#347;vat is significant. It is not that He appears beautiful to the devotees but is ultimately impersonal. &#346;a&#347;vat means "ever existing." That beauty is not temporary. It is ever existing &#8212; He is always youthful. In the Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/33.htm">5.33</A>) it is also stated: advaitam acyutam an&#257;dim ananta-r&#363;pam &#257;dyam pur&#257;na-purusham nava-yauvanam ca. The original person is one without a second, yet He never appears old; He always appears as ever fresh as a blooming youth.</P><P>The Lord's facial expression always indicates that He is ready to show favor and benediction to the devotees; for the nondevotees, however, He is silent. As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, although He acts equally to everyone because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and because all living entities are His sons, He is especially inclined to those engaged in devotional service. The same fact is confirmed here: He is always anxious to show favor to the devotees. Just as the devotees are always eager to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord is also very eager to bestow benediction upon the pure devotees.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
