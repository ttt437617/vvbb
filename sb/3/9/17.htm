As long as their tendency for foolish work remains powerful, all their plans in the struggle for existence will be cut to pieces. I therefore offer my obeisances unto Him who acts as eternal time.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>People in general are all engaged in senseless work. They are systematically unmindful of the real beneficial work, which is the devotional service of the Lord, technically called the arcan&#257; regulations. The arcan&#257; regulations are directly instructed by the Lord in the N&#257;rada-pañcar&#257;tra and are strictly followed by the intelligent men, who know well that the highest perfectional goal of life is to reach Lord Vishnu, who is the root of the tree called the cosmic manifestation. Also, in the Bh&#257;gavatam and in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; such regulative activities are clearly mentioned. Foolish people do not know that their self-interest is in realization of Vishnu. The Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../7/5/30.htm">7.5.30-32</A>) says:</P><P>matir na krishne paratah svato v&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>mitho 'bhipadyeta griha-vrat&#257;n&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>ad&#257;nta-gobhir vi&#347;at&#257;m tamisram</P><P CLASS=n>punah puna&#347; carvita-carvan&#257;n&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>na te viduh sv&#257;rtha-gatim hi vishnum</P><P CLASS=n>dur&#257;&#347;ay&#257; ye bahir-artha-m&#257;ninah</P><P CLASS=n>andh&#257; yath&#257;ndhair upan&#299;yam&#257;n&#257;s</P><P CLASS=n>te 'p&#299;&#347;a-tantry&#257;m uru-d&#257;mni baddh&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>naish&#257;m matis t&#257;vad urukram&#257;&#324;ghrim</P><P CLASS=n>spri&#347;aty anarth&#257;pagamo yad-arthah</P><P CLASS=n>mah&#299;yas&#257;m p&#257;da-rajo-'bhishekam</P><P CLASS=n>nishkiñcan&#257;n&#257;m na vrin&#299;ta y&#257;vat</P><P>"Persons who are determined to totally rot in false, material happiness cannot become Krishna-minded either by instructions from teachers, by self-realization or by parliamentary discussions. They are dragged by the unbridled senses into the darkest region of ignorance, and thus they madly engage in what is called 'chewing the chewed.'</P><P>"Because of their foolish activities, they are unaware that the ultimate goal of human life is to achieve Vishnu, the Lord of the cosmic manifestation, and so their struggle for existence is in the wrong direction of material civilization, which is under the external energy. They are led by similar foolish persons, just as one blind man is led by another blind man and both fall in the ditch.</P><P>"Such foolish men cannot be attracted towards the activities of the Supreme Powerful, who is actually the neutralizing measure for their foolish activities, unless and until they have the good sense to be guided by the great souls who are completely freed from material attachment."</P><P>In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; the Lord asks everyone to give up all other occupational duties and absolutely engage in arcan&#257; activities, or in pleasing the Lord. But almost no one is attracted to such arcan&#257; activity. Everyone is more or less attracted by activities which are conditions of rebellion against the Supreme Lord. The systems of jñ&#257;na and yoga are also indirectly rebellious acts against the Lord. There is no auspicious activity except arcan&#257; of the Lord. Jñ&#257;na and yoga are sometimes accepted within the purview of arcan&#257; when the ultimate aim is Vishnu, and not otherwise. The conclusion is that only the devotees of the Lord are bona fide human beings eligible for salvation. Others are vainly struggling for existence without any actual benefit.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
