By him I was driven out of my own house, although I am his sincere well-wisher, because he accepted the line of action adopted by his own sons.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Vidura did not ask about the welfare of his elder brother because there was no chance of his well-being, only news of his gliding down to hell. Vidura was a sincere well-wisher for Dhritar&#257;shtra, and he had a thought about him in the corner of his heart. He lamented that Dhritar&#257;shtra could rebel against the sons of his dead brother P&#257;ndu and that he could drive him (Vidura) out of his own house on the dictation of his crooked sons. In spite of these actions, Vidura never became an enemy of Dhritar&#257;shtra but continued to be his well-wisher, and at the last stage of Dhritar&#257;shtra's life, it was Vidura only who proved to be his real friend. Such is the behavior of a Vaishnava like Vidura: he desires all good, even for his enemies.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
