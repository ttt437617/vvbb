"Oh, my friend!" or "Oh, my husband!" In that pitiable condition the dying man wants to speak with them and instruct them of his desires, but because he is fully under the control of the time factor, death, he cannot express himself, and that causes him inconceivable pain. He is already in a painful condition because of disease, and his glands and throat are choked up with mucus. He is already in a very difficult position, and when he is addressed by his relatives in that way, his grief increases.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
