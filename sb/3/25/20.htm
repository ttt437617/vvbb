But that same attachment, when applied to the self-realized devotees, opens the door of liberation.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Here it is clearly stated that attachment for one thing is the cause of bondage in conditioned life, and the same attachment, when applied to something else, opens the door of liberation. Attachment cannot be killed; it has simply to be transferred. Attachment for material things is called material consciousness, and attachment for Krishna or His devotee is called Krishna consciousness. Consciousness, therefore, is the platform of attachment. It is clearly stated here that when we simply purify the consciousness from material consciousness to Krishna consciousness, we attain liberation. Despite the statement that one should give up attachment, desirelessness is not possible for a living entity. A living entity, by constitution, has the propensity to be attached to something. We see that if someone has no object of attachment, if he has no children, then he transfers his attachment to cats and dogs. This indicates that the propensity for attachment cannot be stopped; it must be utilized for the best purpose. Our attachment for material things perpetuates our conditional state, but the same attachment, when transferred to the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee, is the source of liberation.</P><P>Here it is recommended that attachment should be transferred to the self-realized devotees, the s&#257;dhus. And who is a s&#257;dhu? A s&#257;dhu is not just an ordinary man with a saffron robe or long beard. A s&#257;dhu is described in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; as one who unflinchingly engages in devotional service. Even though one is found not to be following the strict rules and regulations of devotional service, if one simply has unflinching faith in Krishna, the Supreme Person, he is understood to be a s&#257;dhu. S&#257;dhur eva sa mantavyah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/30.htm">Bg. 9.30</A>]. A s&#257;dhu is a strict follower of devotional service. It is recommended here that if one at all wants to realize Brahman, or spiritual perfection, his attachment should be transferred to the s&#257;dhu, or devotee. Lord Caitanya also confirmed this. Lava-m&#257;tra s&#257;dhu-sa&#324;ge sarva-siddhi haya: [Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/22/54.htm">Madhya 22.54</A>] simply by a moment's association with a s&#257;dhu, one can attain perfection.</P><P>Mah&#257;tm&#257; is a synonym of s&#257;dhu. It is said that service to a mah&#257;tm&#257;, or elevated devotee of the Lord, is dv&#257;ram &#257;hur vimukteh, the royal road of liberation. Mahat-sev&#257;m dv&#257;ram &#257;hur vimuktes tamo-dv&#257;ram yoshit&#257;m sa&#324;gi-sa&#324;gam (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/5/5/2.htm">5.5.2</A>). Rendering service to the materialists has the opposite effect. If anyone offers service to a gross materialist, or a person engaged only in sense enjoyment, then by association with such a person the door to hell is opened. The same principle is confirmed here. Attachment to a devotee is attachment to the service of the Lord because if one associates with a s&#257;dhu, the result will be that the s&#257;dhu will teach him how to become a devotee, a worshiper and a sincere servitor of the Lord. These are the gifts of a s&#257;dhu. If we want to associate with a s&#257;dhu, we cannot expect him to give us instructions on how to improve our material condition, but he will give us instructions on how to cut the knot of the contamination of material attraction and how to elevate ourselves in devotional service. That is the result of associating with a s&#257;dhu. Kapila Muni first of all instructs that the path of liberation begins with such association.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
