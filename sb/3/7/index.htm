If this is His pastime, how do the activities of the unchangeable take place and exhibit qualities without the modes of nature?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>SB 3.7.3</B></A>: Boys are enthusiastic to play with other boys or with various diversions because they are encouraged by desire. But there is no possibility of such desire for the Lord because He is self-satisfied and detached from everything at all times.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 3.7.4</B></A>: By His self-sheltered potency of the three modes of material nature, the Lord has caused the creation of this universe.

My mind is now perfectly entering into them.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 3.7.16</B></A>: O learned sage, your explanations are very good, as they should be. Disturbances to the conditioned soul have no other basis than the movement of the external energy of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 3.7.17</B></A>: Both the lowest of fools and he who is transcendental to all intelligence enjoy happiness, whereas persons between them suffer the material pangs.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 3.7.18</B></A>: But, my dear sir, I am obliged to you because now I can understand that this material manifestation is without substance, although it appears real. I am confident that by serving your feet it will be possible for me to give up the false idea.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 3.7.19</B></A>: By serving the feet of the spiritual master, one is enabled to develop transcendental ecstasy in the service of the Personality of Godhead, who is the unchangeable enemy of the Madhu demon and whose service vanquishes one's material distresses.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 3.7.20</B></A>: Persons whose austerity is meager can hardly obtain the service of the pure devotees who are progressing on the path back to the kingdom of Godhead, the Vaikunthas.
