All the demigods who, in pursuance of the desire of Lord Krishna, had taken birth in the Yadu dynasty to render assistance in His pastimes followed Lord Krishna and returned to their respective abodes. The Lord's activities of creating a life for Himself and then dismantling it are simply tricks of M&#257;y&#257;, like an actor's performance. Actually, He creates the entire universe, and then He enters within it as the Supersoul. In the end, He again winds up the entire universe within Himself and, remaining in His private glory, desists from external pastimes.</P><P>Though overcome by feelings of separation from Krishna, Arjuna was nevertheless able to pacify himself by remembering all the various instructions given to him by the Lord. Arjuna then carried out the rituals of offering pinda and so on for his dead relatives. At that time the ocean swallowed up all of Dv&#257;rak&#257;-pur&#299; except for the Lord's own residence. Arjuna took the remaining members of the Yadu dynasty to Indraprastha, where he installed Vajra upon the throne. Hearing of these events, the P&#257;ndavas, led by Yudhishthira, placed Par&#299;kshit upon their throne and left for the great journey.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../30/50.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
