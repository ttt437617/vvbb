Similarly, the living entity who is asleep to his spiritual identity also sees many sense objects, but these innumerable objects of temporary gratification are creations of the Lord's illusory potency and have no permanent existence. One who meditates upon them, impelled by the senses, uselessly engages his intelligence.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Because the fruits of material work are temporary, it ultimately does not matter whether or not one obtains them; the final result is the same. Materialistic activities can never award the highest perfection of life, Krishna consciousness. The material intelligence, impelled by the senses, strongly desires sense gratification. As stated here (bhed&#257;tma-dh&#299;h), such intelligence actually separates one from one's real self-interest. Thus the intelligence, absorbed in that which is materially favorable and unfavorable, becomes divided in pursuit of innumerable categories of material advancement. Such divided intelligence is impotent and cannot understand the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; Krishna. The devotees of the Lord, however, have their intelligence fixed on one point &#8212; Lord Krishna. They meditate upon the Lord's form, qualities, pastimes and devotees, and thus their intelligence is never separated from the Absolute Truth. As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/2/41.htm">2.41</A>):</P><P>vyavas&#257;y&#257;tmik&#257; buddhir</P><P CLASS=n>ekeha kuru-nandana</P><P CLASS=n>bahu-&#347;&#257;kh&#257; hy ananta&#347; ca</P><P CLASS=n>buddhayo 'vyavas&#257;yin&#257;m</P><P>"Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many branched."</P><P>If one is not Krishna conscious, he is uselessly dreaming without any understanding of his eternal situation. The material intelligence will always devise novel means of achieving happiness, and therefore one bounces from one fruitless program of sense gratification to another, ignoring the simple fact that all material things are temporary and will disappear. In this way one's intelligence becomes infected with material lust and greed, and such infected intelligence cannot bring one to the true goal of life. One should hear from the bona fide spiritual master whose intelligence is pure, and then one will come to Krishna consciousness, the highest perfection of life.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
