Also described are the different practices of the yog&#299;s, beginning with yama.</P><P>The Supreme Lord, &#346;r&#299; Krishna, stated to Uddhava, "One who is actually wise, who knows the truth of the self and possesses transcendental insight, rejects this world of dualities and the so-called knowledge meant for facilitating enjoyment of it. He instead engages himself in trying to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all. This is pure bhakti-yoga. Transcendental knowledge is greater than such ordinary pious activities as chanting of mantras, but pure devotional service is greater than even knowledge."</P><P>After this, Lord Krishna, requested by &#346;r&#299; Uddhava to describe in full detail pure transcendental knowledge and devotional service, related the same instructions that the greatest of Vaishnavas, Bh&#299;shmadeva, gave on these topics to &#346;r&#299; Yudhishthira on the occasion of the battle at Kurukshetra. Following this, after being asked about yama and the other practices of yoga, the Lord enumerated the twelve kinds of yama beginning with nonviolence, and the twelve kinds of niyama, beginning with bodily cleanliness.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../18/48.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
