Even though possessed of full sensual, mental and physical strength, a saintly person should not become active for material gain but rather should always remain alert to his actual self-interest.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The word v&#299;ta-nidrah in this verse is very significant. Nidr&#257; means "sleep" or "ignorance," and v&#299;ta means "freed from." In other words, a transcendentalist should always be awake to his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should carefully cultivate Krishna consciousness. Being confident of his relationship with the Lord, he should not endeavor for his personal maintenance, knowing that the Lord is protecting him in all respects. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura states that the example of the python is given so that one will not uselessly waste his time in bodily maintenance.</P><P>One should not think, however, that the purpose of life is to lie on the ground like a python or to make a show of starving the body. The example of the python should not encourage one to become completely inactive. One should rather become active in spiritual advancement and inactive in material sense gratification. If one becomes completely inactive, that is certainly nidr&#257;, or the darkness of ignorance, in which one remains asleep to his identity as an eternal servant of the Personality of Godhead.</P><P>A transcendentalist is eager to execute his service to the Lord, and therefore he is grateful when the Lord provides material facilities for such service. Mere renunciation of the material world is phalgu-vair&#257;gya, or an immature stage of spiritual understanding. One must come to the stage of yukta-vair&#257;gya, engaging everything in the service of Lord Krishna. It is our practical experience that a devotee absorbed in spreading Krishna consciousness automatically receives all facilities for his personal maintenance.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
