In such a proud and foolish condition, the conditioned souls envy other living entities as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, who resides in the heart of all beings. Thus enviously offending others, the conditioned souls gradually fall down into hell.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Materialistic persons express their envy of animals by cruelly killing them. Similarly, the conditioned souls become envious even of other human beings and of the Lord Himself, who dwells within everyone's body. They express their envy of God by preaching atheistic science or pseudophilosophy in which they ridicule the fact that everyone is an eternal servant of God. Envious persons express their bitter feelings toward other human beings by creating wars, terrorism, cruel governments and cheating business enterprises. The sinful bodies of such envious persons are just like corpses. Still, envious persons are enamored by the corpse of their material body and become further fascinated by their children and other bodily extensions. Such feelings are based in false pride. &#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya has quoted the following verse from Hari-vam&#347;a:</P><P>&#257;ptatv&#257;d &#257;tma-&#347;abdoktam</P><P CLASS=n>svasminn api pareshu ca</P><P CLASS=n>j&#299;v&#257;d anyam na pa&#347;yanti</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;rutvaivam vidvishanti ca</P><P CLASS=n>et&#257;ms tvam &#257;sur&#257;n viddhi</P><P CLASS=n>lakshanaih purush&#257;dham&#257;n</P><P>"The Supreme is called &#257;tm&#257; because He is found both in oneself and within others. Some persons become agitated by hearing descriptions of the Supreme Lord, and they openly state that there is no superior living being beyond themselves. Such persons are to be known as demons. By their practical symptoms they are to be understood as the lowest class of men."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
