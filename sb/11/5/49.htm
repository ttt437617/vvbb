The Lord has concealed His inconceivable opulences and is thus outwardly appearing to be an ordinary human being.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna is the original source of all plenary incarnations of the Absolute Truth. Krishnas tu bhagav&#257;n svayam. His unlimited transcendental opulences are inexhaustible, and thus He very easily brings the entire creation under His personal control. Lord Krishna is the eternal well-wisher of every living entity, so there was no need for Vasudeva to be anxious about his future destination, nor that of the other personal associates of Krishna, such as the members of the Yadu dynasty. In verse 46 of this chapter, N&#257;rada Muni told Vasudeva, putrat&#257;m agamad yad v&#257;m bhagav&#257;n &#299;&#347;varo harih: "You and your good wife are now glorified throughout the universe because Lord Krishna has personally become your son." In this way N&#257;rada is encouraging Vasudeva to continue to love Krishna as his most beloved son, for such ecstatic devotional feelings are never to be given up. But at the same time, N&#257;rada is removing Vasudeva's doubts about the future by assuring him, "Due to your love for Krishna you may think that He is an ordinary human being. You are appearing like a human being, and Lord Krishna is simply reciprocating with you. In order to encourage you to love Him as your son, He is placing Himself under your control. And thus, His inconceivable power and opulences are being concealed from you. Don't assume, however, that there is actually a dangerous situation because of the events of this material world. Although Krishna appears to be under your control, He is eternally the supreme controller. Therefore, do not consider Him to be a human being. He is always the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</P><P>The word m&#257;y&#257; in this verse indicates that Krishna's manushya, or humanlike, activities are actually misleading to the ordinary man because Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. M&#257;y&#257; also means "transcendental potencies." As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, sambhav&#257;my &#257;tma-m&#257;yay&#257;: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/6.htm">Bg. 4.6</A>] the Lord descends in His own transcendental form filled with transcendental potencies. And thus the words m&#257;y&#257;-manushya-bh&#257;vena here also indicate Krishna's original transcendental form, which resembles the humanlike forms experienced in this world. M&#257;y&#257; also indicates "mercy," or "compassion," according to the Sanskrit dictionary, and thus the Lord's incarnation is understood to be His causeless mercy upon the conditioned souls. The Lord's descent is also His causeless mercy upon the liberated souls, who take immense pleasure in joining the Lord in His pastimes and in chanting and hearing about such exalted spiritual activities (&#347;ravanam k&#299;rtanam vishnoh [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../7/5/23.htm">SB 7.5.23</A>]).</P><P>In order to reciprocate the love of Vasudeva for Him, Krishna mostly concealed His unlimited opulences. In this way the devotee is fully encouraged in his particular loving relationship with the Lord. However, when Vasudeva was filled with anxiety due to the dangerous situation created by the br&#257;hmana's curse, N&#257;rada immediately reminded him that such anxiety was unnecessary, since all these events were under the direct control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, the Vaishnava paramahamsas who take the position of the Lord's parents remain under the shelter of the Lord at all times and never deviate from the loving devotional service of the Lord. They remain fixed in transcendence in all circumstances, unlike ordinary parents of the material world, who are constantly becoming bewildered by illusion due to the bodily concept of life.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
