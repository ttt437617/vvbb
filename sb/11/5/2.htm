Thus the four spiritual orders were also generated.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Those who are not spontaneously attracted to the devotional service of the Lord can be gradually purified by observing the varn&#257;&#347;rama system of four social orders and four spiritual orders. According to &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;, the br&#257;hmanas are born of the mode of goodness, the kshatriyas of a combination of goodness and passion, the vai&#347;yas of a combination of passion and ignorance and the &#347;&#363;dras of the mode of ignorance. Just as the four social orders are born from the face, arms, thighs and feet of the Lord's universal form, similarly the brahmac&#257;r&#299;s are generated from the heart of the Lord, the householder order from His loins, the v&#257;naprasthas from His chest and the sanny&#257;sa order from His head.</P><P>A similar verse is found in the Rik-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/8/4/19.htm">8.4.19</A>), as well as the &#346;ukla-yajur Veda (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/veda34/11">34.11</A>) and the Atharva Veda (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/veda19/66">19.66</A>):</P><P>br&#257;hmano 'sya mukham &#257;s&#299;d</P><P CLASS=n>b&#257;h&#363; r&#257;janyah kritah</P><P CLASS=n>&#363;r&#363; tad asya yad vai&#347;yah</P><P CLASS=n>padbhy&#257;m &#347;&#363;dro 'j&#257;yata</P><P>"The br&#257;hmana appeared as His face, the king as His arms, the vai&#347;ya as His thighs, and the &#347;&#363;dra was born from His feet."</P><P>It is understood that pure devotional service to the Lord has already been described by two of the Yogendras, Drumila and &#256;virhotra. Camasa Muni now describes the system of varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma, because this system is meant to gradually purify those who are inimical to the Supreme Lord, bringing them back to their constitutional position of love of Godhead. Similarly, the vir&#257;t-r&#363;pa, or universal form of the Lord, is an imaginary form meant to help the gross materialists gradually understand the position of the Personality of Godhead. Since the foolish materialist cannot understand anything beyond matter, he is encouraged to see the entire universe as a personal form of the Supreme Lord's body. The impersonal conception of formlessness is a mere negation of temporary material variety without any concept of the Lord's spiritual potency. The impersonal view is another kind of material speculative conception. The Supreme Lord is full of spiritual potencies under the principal headings hl&#257;din&#299;, or unlimited bliss, sandhin&#299;, or eternal existence, and samvit, or omniscience. It is understood from this verse that the varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma system generated from the universal form of the Lord is a program offered by the Lord to engage the conditioned souls in a complete social and religious system that gradually brings them back home, back to Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
