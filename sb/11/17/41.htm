If the br&#257;hmana considers that those two occupations also compromise his spiritual position, then he should collect rejected grains in agricultural fields and live without any dependence on others.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>A pure devotee of the Lord should always remember that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will personally take care of him. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/22.htm">9.22</A>):</P><P>anany&#257;&#347; cintayanto m&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>ye jan&#257;h paryup&#257;sate</P><P CLASS=n>tesh&#257;m nity&#257;bhiyukt&#257;n&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>yoga-kshemam vah&#257;my aham</P><P>"But those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form &#8212; to them I carry what they lack and preserve what they have."</P><P>A br&#257;hmana should not become a professional beggar for his personal maintenance. In India there are many so-called br&#257;hmanas who sit at the gates of important temples and beg from everyone who comes and goes. If someone does not give a donation they become angry and chase that person. Similarly, in America there are many big preachers who collect huge amounts of money by begging on television and radio. If a br&#257;hmana or Vaishnava considers that being a professional beggar is weakening his austerity, destroying his spiritual influence and giving him a bad reputation, then he should give up that process. One may beg everyone to contribute to the cause of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but one will be diminished in austerity, influence and reputation by begging for one's personal livelihood. A br&#257;hmana may then take up the task of teaching Vedic knowledge and performing sacrifice. But even such occupations do not bring one to the highest platform of trust in God. A br&#257;hmana who teaches as a means of livelihood may often be curbed in his teaching, and one who performs sacrifice may be manipulated by materialistic worshipers. In this way, a br&#257;hmana may be placed in an embarrassing and compromised position. Therefore a high-class br&#257;hmana or Vaishnava ultimately will depend completely on the mercy of the Lord for his maintenance. The Lord promises to maintain His devotee, and an advanced Vaishnava never doubts the word of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
