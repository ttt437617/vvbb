My dear lotus-eyed Lord, now please explain to me how all human beings can achieve loving service unto You by the execution of their prescribed duties.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3-4.htm"><B>SB 11.17.3-4</B></A>: My dear Lord, O mighty-armed one, previously in Your form of Lord Hamsa You spoke to Lord Brahm&#257; those religious principles that bring supreme happiness to the practitioner.

Now please learn from Me those supreme religious principles.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 11.17.10</B></A>: In the beginning, in Satya-yuga, there is only one social class, called hamsa, to which all human beings belong.

If the br&#257;hmana considers that those two occupations also compromise his spiritual position, then he should collect rejected grains in agricultural fields and live without any dependence on others.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm"><B>SB 11.17.42</B></A>: The body of a br&#257;hmana is not intended to enjoy insignificant material sense gratification; rather, by accepting difficult austerities in his life, a br&#257;hmana will enjoy unlimited happiness after death.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm"><B>SB 11.17.43</B></A>: A br&#257;hmana householder should remain satisfied in mind by gleaning rejected grains from agricultural fields and marketplaces.

Thus considering the demigods, sages, forefathers, living entities and human beings to be manifestations of My potency, one should daily perform these five sacrifices.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm"><B>SB 11.17.51</B></A>: A householder should comfortably maintain his dependents either with money that comes of its own accord or with that gathered by honest execution of one's duties.

In this way he will not be bound or entangled by domestic affairs.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm"><B>SB 11.17.55</B></A>: A householder devotee who worships Me by execution of his family duties may remain at home, go to a holy place or, if he has a responsible son, take sanny&#257;sa.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="56.htm"><B>SB 11.17.56</B></A>: But a householder whose mind is attached to his home and who is thus disturbed by ardent desires to enjoy his money and children, who is lusty after women, who is possessed of a miserly mentality and who unintelligently thinks, "Everything is mine and I am everything," is certainly bound in illusion.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="57.htm"><B>SB 11.17.57</B></A>: "O my poor elderly parents, and my wife with a mere infant in her arms, and my other young children! Without me they have absolutely no one to protect them and will suffer unbearably. How can my poor relatives possibly live without me?"</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="58.htm"><B>SB 11.17.58</B></A>: Thus, because of his foolish mentality, a householder whose heart is overwhelmed by family attachment is never satisfied.
