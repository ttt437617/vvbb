What to speak of acquiring fame, the great poets who described the beauty of the Lord's form would have their words invested with transcendentally pleasing attraction. And by seeing that form on Arjuna's chariot, all the warriors on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained the liberation of gaining a spiritual body similar to the Lord's.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 11.30.4</B></A>: &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: Having observed many disturbing signs in the sky, on the earth and in outer space, Lord Krishna addressed the Yadus assembled in the Sudharm&#257; council hall as follows.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 11.30.5</B></A>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O leaders of the Yadu dynasty, please note all these terrible omens that have appeared in Dv&#257;rak&#257; just like the flags of death. We should not remain here a moment longer.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 11.30.6</B></A>: The women, children and old men should leave this city and go to &#346;a&#324;khoddh&#257;ra. We shall go to Prabh&#257;sa-kshetra, where the river Sarasvat&#299; flows toward the west.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 11.30.7</B></A>: There we should bathe for purification, fast, and fix our minds in meditation.

Friends fought with friends, and well-wishers with well-wishers. In this way intimate friends and relatives all killed one another.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 11.30.20</B></A>: When all their bows had been broken and their arrows and other missiles spent, they seized the tall stalks of cane with their bare hands.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>SB 11.30.21</B></A>: As soon as they took these cane stalks in their fists, the stalks changed into iron rods as hard as thunderbolts.

Picking up cane stalks, They moved about within the battle and began to kill with these clubs.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>SB 11.30.24</B></A>: The violent anger of these warriors, who were overcome by the br&#257;hmanas' curse and bewildered by Lord Krishna's illusory potency, now led them to their annihilation, just as a fire that starts in a bamboo grove destroys the entire forest.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm"><B>SB 11.30.25</B></A>: When all the members of His own dynasty were thus destroyed, Lord Krishna thought to Himself that at last the burden of the earth had been removed.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>SB 11.30.26</B></A>: Lord Balar&#257;ma then sat down on the shore of the ocean and fixed Himself in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Merging Himself within Himself, He gave up this mortal world.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>SB 11.30.27</B></A>: Lord Krishna, the son of Devak&#299;, having seen the departure of Lord R&#257;ma, sat down silently on the ground under a nearby pippala tree.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28-32.htm"><B>SB 11.30.28-32</B></A>: The Lord was exhibiting His brilliantly effulgent four-armed form, the radiance of which, just like a smokeless fire, dissipated the darkness in all directions. His complexion was the color of a dark blue cloud and His effulgence the color of molten gold, and His all-auspicious form bore the mark of &#346;r&#299;vatsa. A beautiful smile graced His lotus face, locks of dark blue hair adorned His head, His lotus eyes were very attractive, and His shark-shaped earrings glittered. He wore a pair of silken garments, an ornamental belt, the sacred thread, bracelets and arm ornaments, along with a helmet, the Kaustubha jewel, necklaces, anklets and other royal emblems. Encircling His body were flower garlands and His personal weapons in their embodied forms. As He sat He held His left foot, with its lotus-red sole, upon His right thigh.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>SB 11.30.33</B></A>: Just then a hunter named Jar&#257;, who had approached the place, mistook the Lord's foot for a deer's face. Thinking he had found his prey, Jar&#257; pierced the foot with his arrow, which he had fashioned from the remaining iron fragment of S&#257;mba's club.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>SB 11.30.34</B></A>: Then, seeing that four-armed personality, the hunter became terrified of the offense he had committed, and he fell down, placing his head upon the feet of the enemy of the demons.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm"><B>SB 11.30.35</B></A>: Jar&#257; said: O Lord Madhus&#363;dana, I am a most sinful person. I have committed this act out of ignorance. O purest Lord, O Uttamah&#347;loka, please forgive this sinner.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>SB 11.30.36</B></A>: O Lord Vishnu, the learned say that for any man, constant remembrance of You will destroy the darkness of ignorance. O master, I have wronged You!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>SB 11.30.37</B></A>: Therefore, O Lord of Vaikuntha, please kill this sinful hunter of animals immediately so he may not again commit such offenses against saintly persons.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm"><B>SB 11.30.38</B></A>: Neither Brahm&#257; nor his sons, headed by Rudra, nor any of the great sages who are masters of the Vedic mantras can understand the function of Your mystic power. Because Your illusory potency has covered their sight, they remain ignorant of how Your mystic power works. Therefore, what can I, such a low-born person, possibly say?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm"><B>SB 11.30.39</B></A>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Jar&#257;, do not fear. Please get up. What has been done is actually My own desire. With My permission, go now to the abode of the pious, the spiritual world.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm"><B>SB 11.30.40</B></A>: So instructed by the Supreme Lord Krishna, who assumes His transcendental body by His own will, the hunter circumambulated the Lord three times and bowed down to Him. Then the hunter departed in an airplane that had appeared just to carry him to the spiritual sky.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm"><B>SB 11.30.41</B></A>: At that time D&#257;ruka was searching for his master, Krishna. As he neared the place where the Lord was sitting, he perceived the aroma of tulas&#299; flowers in the breeze and went in its direction.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm"><B>SB 11.30.42</B></A>: Upon seeing Lord Krishna resting at the foot of a banyan tree, surrounded by His shining weapons, D&#257;ruka could not control the affection he felt in his heart. His eyes filled with tears as he rushed down from the chariot and fell at the Lord's feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm"><B>SB 11.30.43</B></A>: D&#257;ruka said: Just as on a moonless night people are merged into darkness and cannot find their way, now that I have lost sight of Your lotus feet, my Lord, I have lost my vision and am wandering blindly in darkness. I cannot tell my direction, nor can I find any peace.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm"><B>SB 11.30.44</B></A>: [&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continued:] O foremost of kings, while the chariot driver was still speaking, before his very eyes the Lord's chariot rose up into the sky along with its horses and its flag, which was marked with the emblem of Garuda.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm"><B>SB 11.30.45</B></A>: All the divine weapons of Vishnu rose up and followed the chariot. The Lord, Jan&#257;rdana, then spoke to His chariot driver, who was most astonished to see all this.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm"><B>SB 11.30.46</B></A>: O driver, go to Dv&#257;rak&#257; and tell Our family members how their loved ones destroyed one another. Also tell them of the disappearance of Lord Sa&#324;karshana and of My present condition.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm"><B>SB 11.30.47</B></A>: You and your relatives should not remain in Dv&#257;rak&#257;, the capital of the Yadus, because once I have abandoned that city it will be inundated by the ocean.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm"><B>SB 11.30.48</B></A>: You should all take your own families, together with My parents, and under Arjuna's protection go to Indraprastha.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm"><B>SB 11.30.49</B></A>: You, D&#257;ruka, should be firmly situated in devotion to Me, remaining fixed in spiritual knowledge and unattached to material considerations. Understanding these pastimes to be a display of My illusory potency, you should remain peaceful.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm"><B>SB 11.30.50</B></A>: Thus ordered, D&#257;ruka circumambulated the Lord and offered obeisances to Him again and again. He placed Lord Krishna's lotus feet upon his head and then with a sad heart went back to the city.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
