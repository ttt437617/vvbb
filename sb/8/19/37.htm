Such a person is happy in this world and in the next.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The &#347;&#257;stras enjoin that if one has money one should divide all that he has accumulated into five divisions &#8212; one part for religion, one part for reputation, one part for opulence, one part for sense gratification and one part to maintain the members of his family. At the present, however, because people are bereft of all knowledge, they spend all their money for the satisfaction of their family. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; taught us by his own example by using fifty percent of his accumulated wealth for Krishna, twenty-five percent for his own self, and twenty-five percent for the members of his family. One's main purpose should be to advance in Krishna consciousness. This will include dharma, artha and k&#257;ma. However, because one's family members expect some profit, one should also satisfy them by giving them a portion of one's accumulated wealth. This is a &#347;&#257;stric injunction.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
