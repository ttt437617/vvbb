A person who is not self-controlled will not be happy even with possessing the three worlds.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>If happiness is the ultimate goal of life, one must be satisfied with the position in which he is placed by providence. This instruction is also given by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja:</P><P>sukham aindriyakam daity&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>deha-yogena dehin&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>sarvatra labhyate daiv&#257;d</P><P CLASS=n>yath&#257; duhkham ayatnatah</P><P>"My dear friends born of demoniac families, the happiness perceived with reference to the sense objects by contact with the body can be obtained in any form of life, according to one's past fruitive activities. Such happiness is automatically obtained without endeavor, just as we obtain distress." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/7/6/3.htm">7.6.3</A>) This philosophy is perfect in regard to obtaining happiness.</P><P>Real happiness is described in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/6/21.htm">6.21</A>):</P><P>sukham &#257;tyantikam yat tad</P><P CLASS=n>buddhi-gr&#257;hyam at&#299;ndriyam</P><P CLASS=n>vetti yatra na caiv&#257;yam</P><P CLASS=n>sthita&#347; calati tattvatah</P><P>"In the spiritually joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth." One has to perceive happiness by the supersenses. The supersenses are not the senses of the material elements. Every one of us is a spiritual being (aham brahm&#257;smi), and every one of us is an individual person. Our senses are now covered by material elements, and because of ignorance we consider the material senses that cover us to be our real senses. The real senses, however, are within the material covering. Dehino'smin yath&#257; dehe: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/2/13.htm">Bg. 2.13</A>] within the covering of the material elements are the spiritual senses. Sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam: [Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/19/170.htm">Madhya 19.170</A>] when the spiritual senses are uncovered, by these senses we can be happy. Satisfaction of the spiritual senses is thus described: hrish&#299;kena hrish&#299;ke&#347;a-sevanam bhaktir ucyate. When the senses are engaged in devotional service to Hrish&#299;ke&#347;a, then the senses are completely satisfied. Without this superior knowledge of sense gratification, one may try to satisfy his material senses, but happiness will never be possible. One may increase his ambition for sense gratification and even achieve what he desires for the gratification of his senses, but because this is on the material platform, he will never achieve satisfaction and contentment.</P><P>According to brahminical culture, one should be content with whatever he obtains without special endeavor and should cultivate spiritual consciousness. Then he will be happy. The purpose of the Krishna consciousness movement is to spread this understanding. People who do not have scientific spiritual knowledge mistakenly think that the members of the Krishna consciousness movement are escapists trying to avoid material activities. In fact, however, we are engaged in real activities for obtaining the ultimate happiness in life. If one is not trained to satisfy the spiritual senses and continues in material sense gratification, he will never obtain happiness that is eternal and blissful. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../5/5/1.htm">5.5.1</A>) therefore recommends:</P><P>tapo divyam putrak&#257; yena sattvam</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;uddhyed yasm&#257;d brahma-saukhyam tv anantam</P><P>One must practice austerity so that his existential position will be purified and he will achieve unlimited blissful life.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
