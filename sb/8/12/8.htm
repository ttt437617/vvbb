Therefore, although You appear to be two, You are the absolute one. As there is no difference between the gold of a golden ornament and the gold in a mine, there is no difference between cause and effect; both of them are the same. Only because of ignorance do people concoct differences and dualities. You are free from material contamination, and since the entire cosmos is caused by You and cannot exist without You, it is an effect of Your transcendental qualities. Thus the conception that Brahman is true and the world false cannot be maintained.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura says that the living entities are representations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's marginal potency whereas the various bodies accepted by the living entities are products of the material energy. Thus the body is considered material, and the soul is considered spiritual. The origin of them both, however, is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord explains in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/4.htm">7.4-5</A>):</P><P>bh&#363;mir &#257;po 'nalo v&#257;yuh</P><P CLASS=n>kham mano buddhir eva ca</P><P CLASS=n>aha&#324;k&#257;ra it&#299;yam me</P><P CLASS=n>bhinn&#257; prakritir ashtadh&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>apareyam itas tv any&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>prakritim viddhi me par&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>j&#299;va-bh&#363;t&#257;m mah&#257;-b&#257;ho</P><P CLASS=n>yayedam dh&#257;ryate jagat</P><P>"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego &#8212; all together these eight comprise My separated material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe." Thus both matter and the living entities are manifestations of energy of the Supreme Lord. Since the energy and the energetic are not different and since the material and marginal energies are both energies of the supreme energetic, the Supreme Lord, ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead is everything. In this regard, the example may be given of gold that has not been molded and gold that has been molded into various ornaments. A gold earring and the gold in a mine are different only as cause and effect; otherwise they are the same. The Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra describes that Brahman is the cause of everything. Janm&#257;dy asya yatah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/1/1.htm">SB 1.1.1</A>]. Everything is born of the Supreme Brahman, from which everything emanates as different energies. None of these energies, therefore, should be considered false. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s' differentiation between Brahman and m&#257;y&#257; is only due to ignorance.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;mad V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya, in his Bh&#257;gavata-candra-candrik&#257;, describes the Vaishnava philosophy as follows. The cosmic manifestation is described as sat and asat, as cit and acit. Matter is acit, and the living force is cit, but their origin is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in whom there is no difference between matter and spirit. According to this conception, the cosmic manifestation, consisting of both matter and spirit, is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Idam hi vi&#347;vam bhagav&#257;n ivetarah: "This cosmic manifestation is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although it appears different from Him." In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/4.htm">9.4</A>) the Lord says:</P><P>may&#257; tatam idam sarvam</P><P CLASS=n>jagad avyakta-m&#363;rtin&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>mat-sth&#257;ni sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni</P><P CLASS=n>na c&#257;ham teshv avasthitah</P><P>"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them." Thus although someone may say that the Supreme Person is different from the cosmic manifestation, actually He is not. The Lord says, may&#257; tatam idam sarvam: "In My impersonal feature I am spread throughout the world." Therefore, this world is not different from Him. The difference is a difference in names. For example, whether we speak of gold earrings, gold bangles or gold necklaces, ultimately they are all gold. In a similar way, all the different manifestations of matter and spirit are ultimately one in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. ekam ev&#257;dvit&#299;yam brahma. This is the Vedic version (Ch&#257;ndogya Upanishad <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/6/2/1">6.2.1</A>). There is oneness because everything emanates from the Supreme Brahman. The example already given is that there is no difference between a golden earring and the gold mine as it is. The Vai&#347;eshika philosophers, however, because of their M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da conception, create differences. They say, brahma satyam jagan mithy&#257;: "The Absolute Truth is real, and the cosmic manifestation is false." But why should the jagat be considered mithy&#257;? The jagat is an emanation from Brahman. Therefore the jagat is also truth.</P><P>Vaishnavas, therefore, do not consider the jagat to be mithy&#257;; rather, they regard everything as reality in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P>an&#257;saktasya vishay&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>yath&#257;rham upayuñjatah</P><P CLASS=n>nirbandhah krishna-sambandhe</P><P CLASS=n>yuktam vair&#257;gyam ucyate</P><P CLASS=n>pr&#257;pañcikatay&#257; buddhy&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>hari-sambandhi-vastunah</P><P CLASS=n>mumukshubhih parity&#257;go</P><P CLASS=n>vair&#257;gyam phalgu kathyate</P><P>"Things should be accepted for the Lord's service and not for one's personal sense gratification. If one accepts something without attachment and accepts it because it is related to Krishna, one's renunciation is called yuktam vair&#257;gyam. Whatever is favorable for the rendering of service to the Lord should be accepted and should not be rejected as a material thing." (Bhakti-ras&#257;mrita-sindhu <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/brs1/2/255">1.2.255-256</A>) The jagat should not be rejected as mithy&#257;. It is truth, and the truth is realized when everything is engaged in the service of the Lord. A flower accepted for one's sense gratification is material, but when the same flower is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a devotee, it is spiritual. Food taken and cooked for oneself is material, but food cooked for the Supreme Lord is spiritual pras&#257;da. This is a question of realization. Actually, everything is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore everything is spiritual, but those who are not advanced in proper knowledge make distinctions because of the interactions of the three modes of material nature. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that although the sun is the only light, the sunshine, which is exhibited in seven colors, and darkness, which is the absence of sunshine, are not different from the sun, for without the existence of the sun such differentiations cannot exist. There may be varied nomenclature because of different conditions, but they are all the sun. The pur&#257;nas therefore say:</P><P>eka-de&#347;a-sthitasy&#257;gner</P><P CLASS=n>jyotsn&#257; vist&#257;rin&#299; yath&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>parasya brahmanah &#347;aktis</P><P CLASS=n>tathedam akhilam jagat</P><P>"Just as the illumination of a fire, which is situated in one place, is spread all over, the energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Parabrahman, are spread all over this universe." (Vishnu Pur&#257;na <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/purana1/22/53">1.22.53</A>) Materially, we can directly perceive the sunshine spreading itself according to different names and activities, but ultimately the sun is one. Similarly, sarvam khalv idam brahma: everything is an expansion of the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, the Supreme Lord is everything, and He is one without differentiation. There is no existence separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
