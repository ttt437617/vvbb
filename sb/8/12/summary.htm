When Lord &#346;iva heard about the pastimes performed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, in the form of an attractive woman, he mounted his bull and went to see the Lord. Accompanied by his wife, Um&#257;, and his servants, the bh&#363;ta-gana, or ghosts, he approached the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord &#346;iva offered obeisances to the Supreme Lord as the all-pervading Lord, the universal form, the supreme controller of creation, the Supersoul, the resting place for everyone, and the completely independent cause of all causes. Thus he offered prayers giving truthful descriptions of the Lord. Then he expressed his desire. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is very kind to His devotees. Therefore, to fulfill the desire of His devotee Lord &#346;iva, He expanded His energy and manifested Himself in the form of a very beautiful and attractive woman. Upon seeing this form, even Lord &#346;iva was captivated. Later, by the grace of the Lord, he controlled himself. This demonstrates that by the power of the Lord's external energy, everyone is captivated by the form of woman in this material world. Again, however, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can overcome the influence of m&#257;y&#257;. This was evinced by Lord &#346;iva, the topmost devotee of the Lord. First he was captivated, but later, by the grace of the Lord, he restrained himself. It is declared in this connection that only a pure devotee can restrain himself from the attractive feature of m&#257;y&#257;. Otherwise, once a living entity is trapped by the external feature of m&#257;y&#257;, he cannot overcome it. After Lord &#346;iva was graced by the Supreme Lord, he circumambulated the Lord along with his wife, Bhav&#257;n&#299;, and his companions, the ghosts. Then he left for his own abode. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; concludes this chapter by describing the transcendental qualities of Uttama&#347;loka, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and by declaring that one can glorify the Lord by nine kinds of devotional service, beginning with &#347;ravanam k&#299;rtanam</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../11/48.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1-2.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
