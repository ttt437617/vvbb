His four hands were decorated with a conchshell, club, lotus and disc, He was dressed in yellow garments, and His eyes appeared like the petals of a blooming lotus.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>SB 8.18.2</B></A>: The body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, blackish in complexion, was free from all inebrieties. His lotus face, decorated with earrings resembling sharks, appeared very beautiful, and on His bosom was the mark of &#346;r&#299;vatsa. He wore bangles on His wrists, armlets on His arms, a helmet on His head, a belt on His waist, a sacred thread across His chest, and ankle bells decorating His lotus feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>SB 8.18.3</B></A>: An uncommonly beautiful garland of flowers decorated His bosom, and because the flowers were extremely fragrant, a large group of bees, making their natural humming sounds, invaded them for honey. When the Lord appeared, wearing the Kaustubha gem on His neck, His effulgence vanquished the darkness in the home of the Praj&#257;pati Ka&#347;yapa.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 8.18.4</B></A>: At that time, there was happiness in all directions, in the reservoirs of water like the rivers and oceans, and in the core of everyone's heart. The various seasons displayed their respective qualities, and all living entities in the upper planetary system, in outer space and on the surface of the earth were jubilant. The demigods, the cows, the br&#257;hmanas and the hills and mountains were all filled with joy.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 8.18.5</B></A>: On the day of &#346;ravana-dv&#257;da&#347;&#299; [the twelfth day of the bright fortnight in the month of Bh&#257;dra], when the moon came into the lunar mansion &#346;ravana, at the auspicious moment of Abhijit, the Lord appeared in this universe. Considering the Lord's appearance very auspicious, all the stars and planets, from the sun to Saturn, were munificently charitable.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 8.18.6</B></A>: O King, when the Lord appeared &#8212; on dv&#257;da&#347;&#299;, the twelfth day of the moon &#8212; the sun was at the meridian, as every learned scholar knows. This dv&#257;da&#347;&#299; is called Vijay&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 8.18.7</B></A>: Conchshells, kettledrums, drums, panavas and &#257;nakas vibrated in concert. The sound of these and various other instruments was tumultuous.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 8.18.8</B></A>: Being very pleased, the celestial dancing girls [Apsar&#257;s] danced in jubilation, the best of the Gandharvas sang songs, and the great sages, demigods, Manus, Pit&#257;s and fire-gods offered prayers to satisfy the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9-10.htm"><B>SB 8.18.9-10</B></A>: The Siddhas, Vidy&#257;dharas, Kimpurushas, Kinnaras, C&#257;ranas, Yakshas, R&#257;kshasas, Suparnas, the best of serpents, and the followers of the demigods all showered flowers on Aditi's residence, covering the entire house, while glorifying and praising the Lord and dancing.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 8.18.11</B></A>: When Aditi saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who had appeared from her own womb, having accepted a transcendental body by His own spiritual potency, she was struck with wonder and was very happy. Upon seeing the child, Praj&#257;pati Ka&#347;yapa exclaimed, "Jaya! Jaya!" in great happiness and wonder.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 8.18.12</B></A>: The Lord appeared in His original form, with ornaments and weapons in His hands. Although this ever-existing form is not visible in the material world, He nonetheless appeared in this form. Then, in the presence of His father and mother, He assumed the form of V&#257;mana, a br&#257;hmana-dwarf, a brahmac&#257;r&#299;, just like a theatrical actor.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 8.18.13</B></A>: When the great sages saw the Lord as the brahmac&#257;r&#299;-dwarf V&#257;mana, they were certainly very pleased. Thus they placed before them Ka&#347;yapa Muni, the Praj&#257;pati, and performed all the ritualistic ceremonies, such as the birthday ceremony.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 8.18.14</B></A>: At the sacred thread ceremony of V&#257;manadeva, the sun-god personally uttered the G&#257;yatr&#299; mantra, Brihaspati offered the sacred thread, and Ka&#347;yapa Muni offered a straw belt.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 8.18.15</B></A>: Mother earth gave Him a deerskin, and the demigod of the moon, who is the king of the forest, gave Him a brahma-danda [the rod of a brahmac&#257;r&#299;]. His mother, Aditi, gave Him cloth for underwear, and the deity presiding over the heavenly kingdom offered Him an umbrella.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 8.18.16</B></A>: O King, Lord Brahm&#257; offered a waterpot to the inexhaustible Supreme Personality of Godhead, the seven sages offered Him ku&#347;a grass, and mother Sarasvat&#299; gave Him a string of Rudr&#257;ksha beads.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 8.18.17</B></A>: When V&#257;manadeva had thus been given the sacred thread, Kuvera, King of the Yakshas, gave Him a pot for begging alms, and mother Bhagavat&#299;, the wife of Lord &#346;iva and most chaste mother of the entire universe, gave Him His first alms.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 8.18.18</B></A>: Having thus been welcomed by everyone, Lord V&#257;manadeva, the best of the brahmac&#257;r&#299;s, exhibited His Brahman effulgence. Thus He surpassed in beauty that entire assembly, which was filled with great saintly br&#257;hmanas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 8.18.19</B></A>: After Lord &#346;r&#299; V&#257;manadeva set a sacrificial fire, He offered worship and performed a fire sacrifice on the sacrificial field.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 8.18.20</B></A>: When the Lord heard that Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was performing a&#347;vamedha sacrifices under the patronage of br&#257;hmanas belonging to the Bhrigu dynasty, the Supreme Lord, who is full in every respect, proceeded there to show His mercy to Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. By His weight, He pushed down the earth with every step.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>SB 8.18.21</B></A>: While engaged in performing the sacrifice in the field known as Bhrigukaccha, on the northern bank of the Narmad&#257; River, the brahminical priests, the descendants of Bhrigu, saw V&#257;manadeva to be like the sun rising nearby.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>SB 8.18.22</B></A>: O King, because of V&#257;manadeva's bright effulgence, the priests, along with Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and all the members of the assembly, were robbed of their splendor. Thus they began to ask one another whether the sun-god himself, Sanat-kum&#257;ra or the fire-god had personally come to see the sacrificial ceremony.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>SB 8.18.23</B></A>: While the priests of the Bhrigu dynasty and their disciples talked and argued in various ways, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V&#257;manadeva, holding in His hands the rod, the umbrella and a waterpot full of water, entered the arena of the a&#347;vamedha sacrifice.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24-25.htm"><B>SB 8.18.24-25</B></A>: Appearing as a br&#257;hmana boy, wearing a belt of straw, a sacred thread, an upper garment of deerskin, and matted locks of hair, Lord V&#257;manadeva entered the arena of sacrifice. His brilliant effulgence diminished the brilliance of all the priests and their disciples, who thus stood from their seats and welcomed the Lord properly by offering obeisances.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>SB 8.18.26</B></A>: Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, jubilant at seeing Lord V&#257;manadeva, whose beautiful limbs contributed equally to the beauty of His entire body, offered Him a seat with great satisfaction.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>SB 8.18.27</B></A>: Thus offering a proper reception to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always beautiful to the liberated souls, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja worshiped Him by washing His lotus feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 8.18.28</B></A>: Lord &#346;iva, the best of demigods, who carries on his forehead the emblem of the moon, receives on his head with great devotion the Ganges water emanating from the toe of Vishnu. Being aware of religious principles, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja knew this. Consequently, following in the footsteps of Lord &#346;iva, he also placed on his head the water that had washed the Lord's lotus feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>SB 8.18.29</B></A>: Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja then said to Lord V&#257;manadeva: O br&#257;hmana, I offer You my hearty welcome and my respectful obeisances. Please let us know what we may do for You. We think of You as the personified austerity of the great br&#257;hmana-sages.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 8.18.30</B></A>: O my Lord, because You have kindly arrived at our home, all my forefathers are satisfied, our family and entire dynasty have been sanctified, and the sacrifice we are performing is now complete because of Your presence.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 8.18.31</B></A>: O son of a br&#257;hmana, today the fire of sacrifice is ablaze according to the injunction of the &#347;&#257;stra, and I have been freed from all the sinful reactions of my life by the water that has washed Your lotus feet. O my Lord, by the touch of Your small lotus feet the entire surface of the world has been sanctified.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>SB 8.18.32</B></A>: O son of a br&#257;hmana, it appears that You have come here to ask me for something. Therefore, whatever You want You may take from me. O best of those who are worshipable. You may take from me a cow, gold, a furnished house, palatable food and drink, the daughter of a br&#257;hmana for Your wife, prosperous villages, horses, elephants, chariots or whatever You desire.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
