Indeed, being extremely merciful, You incessantly try to deliver me. By your partial feature as Param&#257;tm&#257;, You are situated in the hearts of all embodied beings. You are celebrated as direct transcendental knowledge, and You are unlimited. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The words brihate namas te have been explained by &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura: brihate &#347;r&#299;-krishn&#257;ya. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Krishna. There are many tattvas, such as vishnu-tattva, j&#299;va-tattva and &#347;akti-tattva, but above everything is the vishnu-tattva, which is all-pervading. This all-pervading feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is explained in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/42.htm">10.42</A>), wherein the Lord says:</P><P>athav&#257; bahunaitena</P><P CLASS=n>kim jñ&#257;tena tav&#257;rjuna</P><P CLASS=n>vishtabhy&#257;ham idam kritsnam</P><P CLASS=n>ek&#257;m&#347;ena sthito jagat</P><P>"But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe." Thus Krishna says that the entire material world is maintained by His partial representation as Param&#257;tm&#257;. The Lord enters every universe as Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu and then expands Himself as Ksh&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu to enter the hearts of all living entities and even enter the atoms. And&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;nu-cay&#257;ntara-stham. Every universe is full of atoms, and the Lord is not only within the universe but also within the atoms. Thus within every atom the Supreme Lord exists in His Vishnu feature as Param&#257;tm&#257;, but all the vishnu-tattvas emanate from Krishna. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/2.htm">10.2</A>), aham &#257;dir hi dev&#257;n&#257;m: Krishna is the &#257;di, or beginning, of the devas of this material world &#8212; Brahm&#257;, Vishnu and Mahe&#347;vara. Therefore He is described here as bhagavate brihate. Everyone is bhagav&#257;n &#8212; everyone possesses opulence &#8212; but Krishna is brih&#257;n bhagav&#257;n, the possessor of unlimited opulence. &#298;&#347;varah paramah krishnah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>]. Krishna is the origin of everyone. Aham sarvasya prabhavah. Even Brahm&#257;, Vishnu and Mahe&#347;vara come from Krishna. Mattah parataram n&#257;nyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/7.htm">Bg. 7.7</A>] there is no personality superior to Krishna. Therefore Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura says that bhagavate brihate means "unto &#346;r&#299; Krishna."</P><P>In this material world, everyone is a pa&#347;u, an animal, because of the bodily conception of life.</P><P>yasy&#257;tma-buddhih kunape tri-dh&#257;tuke</P><P CLASS=n>sva-dh&#299;h kalatr&#257;dishu bhauma ijya-dh&#299;h</P><P CLASS=n>yat t&#299;rtha-buddhih salile na karhicij</P><P CLASS=n>janeshv abhijñeshu sa eva go-kharah</P><P>"A human being who identifies the body made of three elements as the self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the land of his birth to be worshipable, and who goes to a place of pilgrimage simply to bathe rather than to meet men of transcendental knowledge there is to be considered like a cow or an ass." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/10/84/13.htm">10.84.13</A>) Practically everyone, therefore, is a pa&#347;u, an animal, and everyone is attacked by the crocodile of material existence. Not only the King of the elephants but every one of us is being attacked by the crocodile and is suffering the consequences.</P><P>Only Krishna can deliver us from this material existence. Indeed, He is always trying to deliver us. &#298;&#347;varah sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m hrid-de&#347;e 'rjuna tishthati [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/61.htm">Bg. 18.61</A>]. He is within our hearts and is not at all inattentive. His only aim is to deliver us from material life. It is not that He becomes attentive to us only when we offer prayers to Him. Even before we offer our prayers, He incessantly tries to deliver us. He is never lazy in regard to our deliverance. Therefore this verse says, bh&#363;ri-karun&#257;ya namo 'lay&#257;ya. It is the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord that He always tries to bring us back home, back to Godhead. God is liberated, and He tries to make us liberated, but although He is constantly trying, we refuse to accept His instructions (sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m ekam &#347;aranam vraja [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/66.htm">Bg. 18.66</A>]). Nonetheless, He has not become angry. Therefore He is described here as bh&#363;ri-karun&#257;ya, unlimitedly merciful in delivering us from this miserable material condition of life and taking us back home, back to Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
