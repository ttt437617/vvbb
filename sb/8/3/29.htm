I take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose glories are difficult to understand.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, every living entity &#8212; regardless of whether he be human, demigod, animal, bird, bee or whatever &#8212; is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord and the living entity are intimately related like father and son. Unfortunately, because of material contact, the living entity forgets this and wants to enjoy the material world independently, according to his own plan. This illusion (m&#257;y&#257;) is very difficult to surmount. M&#257;y&#257; covers the living entity because of his willingness to forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead and make his own plan to enjoy this material world. As long as this contamination continues, the conditioned soul will be unable to understand his real identity and will perpetually continue under illusion, life after life. Ato griha-kshetra-sut&#257;pta-vittair janasya moho 'yam aham mameti (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/5/5/8.htm">5.5.8</A>). As long as the living entity is not enlightened so that he may understand his real position, he will be attracted to materialistic life, to house, country or field, to society, sons, family, community, bank balance and so on. Covered by all this, he will continue to think, "I am this body, and everything related to this body is mine." This materialistic conception of life is extremely difficult to surmount, but one who surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as did Gajendra, the King of the elephants, comes to enlightenment on the Brahman platform.</P><P>brahma-bh&#363;tah prasann&#257;tm&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>na &#347;ocati na k&#257;&#324;kshati</P><P CLASS=n>samah sarveshu bh&#363;teshu</P><P CLASS=n>mad-bhaktim labhate par&#257;m</P><P>"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.

(<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/54.htm">Bg. 18.54</A>) Since a devotee is completely on the Brahman platform, he is not jealous of any other living entity (samah sarveshu bh&#363;teshu).</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
