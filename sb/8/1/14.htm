Generally, everyone is attracted to hard labor for becoming happy in this material world, but although various activities are going on all over the world simply for the sake of happiness, unfortunately only problems are being created from such fruitive activities. Therefore it is advised that active persons engage in activities of Krishna consciousness, which are called yajña, because then they will gradually come to the platform of devotional service. Yajña means Lord Vishnu, the yajña-purusha, the enjoyer of all sacrifices (bhokt&#257;ram yajña-tapas&#257;m sarva-loka-mahe&#347;varam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/5/29.htm">Bg. 5.29</A>]). The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the enjoyer, and therefore if we begin our activities for His satisfaction, we will gradually lose our taste for material activities.</P><P>S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; declared to the great assembly of sages at Naimish&#257;ranya:</P><P>atah pumbhir dvija-&#347;reshth&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>varn&#257;&#347;rama-vibh&#257;ga&#347;ah</P><P CLASS=n>svanushthitasya dharmasya</P><P CLASS=n>samsiddhir hari-toshanam</P><P>"O best among the twice-born, it is concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties [dharma] according to caste divisions and order of life, is to please the Lord Hari." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/2/13.htm">1.2.13</A>) According to Vedic principles, everyone must act according to his classification as br&#257;hmana, kshatriya, vai&#347;ya, &#347;&#363;dra, brahmac&#257;r&#299;, grihastha, v&#257;naprastha or sanny&#257;s&#299;. Everyone should progress toward perfection by acting in such a way that Krishna will be pleased (samsiddhir hari-toshanam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/2/13.htm">SB 1.2.13</A>]). One cannot please Krishna by sitting idly; one must act according to the directions of the spiritual master for the sake of pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then one will gradually come to the stage of pure devotional service. As confirmed in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/5/12.htm">1.5.12</A>):</P><P>naishkarmyam apy acyuta-bh&#257;va-varjitam</P><P CLASS=n>na &#347;obhate jñ&#257;nam alam nirañjanam</P><P>"Knowledge of self-realization, even though freed from all material affinity, does not look well if devoid of a conception of the infallible [God]." Jñ&#257;n&#299;s recommend that one adopt naishkarmya by not doing anything but simply meditating and thinking of Brahman, but this is impossible unless one realizes Parabrahman, Krishna. If there is no Krishna consciousness, any kind of activity, be it philanthropic, political or social, simply causes karma-bandhana, bondage to material work.</P><P>As long as one is entangled in karma-bandhana, one must accept different types of bodies that spoil the human form of facility. Therefore, in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/6/3.htm">6.3</A>) karma-yoga is recommended:</P><P>&#257;rurukshor muner yogam</P><P CLASS=n>karma k&#257;ranam ucyate</P><P CLASS=n>yog&#257;r&#363;dhasya tasyaiva</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;amah k&#257;ranam ucyate</P><P>"For one who is a neophyte in the yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means." Nonetheless:</P><P>karmendriy&#257;ni samyamya</P><P CLASS=n>ya &#257;ste manas&#257; smaran</P><P CLASS=n>indriy&#257;rth&#257;n vim&#363;dh&#257;tm&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>mithy&#257;c&#257;rah sa ucyate</P><P>"One who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on sense objects, certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/3/6.htm">Bg. 3.6</A>) One should act for Krishna very seriously in order to become fully Krishna conscious and should not sit down to imitate such great personalities as Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Th&#257;kura condemned such imitation. Me said:</P><P>dushta mana! tumi kisera vaishnava?</P><P>pratishth&#257;ra tare, nirjanera ghare,</P><P CLASS=n>tava hari-n&#257;ma kevala kaitava</P><P>"My dear mind, what kind of devotee are you? Simply for cheap adoration, you sit in a solitary place and pretend to chant the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra, but this is all cheating." Recently at M&#257;y&#257;pur an African devotee wanted to imitate Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura, but after fifteen days he became restless and went away. Do not suddenly try to imitate Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura. Engage yourself in Krishna conscious activities, and gradually you will come to the stage of liberation (muktir hitv&#257;nyath&#257; r&#363;pam svar&#363;pena vyavasthitih).</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
