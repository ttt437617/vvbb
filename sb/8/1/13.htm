He is self-effulgent, unborn and changeless. He is the beginning of everything, but He has no beginning. Because He has created this cosmic manifestation by His external energy, the universe appears to be created, maintained and annihilated by Him. Nonetheless, He remains inactive in His spiritual energy and is untouched by the activities of the material energy.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu says in His &#346;iksh&#257;shtaka, n&#257;mn&#257;m ak&#257;ri bahudh&#257; nija-sarva-&#347;aktih: the Supreme Personality of Godhead has many names, which are all nondifferent from the Supreme Person. This is spiritual existence. By chanting the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra, consisting of names of the Supreme Lord, we find that the name has all the potencies of the person. The Lord's activities are many, and according to His activities He has many names. He appeared as the son of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, and also as the son of mother Devak&#299;, and therefore He is named Devak&#299;-nandana and Ya&#347;od&#257;-nandana. Par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate: the Lord has a multitude of energies, and therefore He acts in multifarious ways. Yet He has a particular name. The &#347;&#257;stras recommend which names we should chant, such as Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. It is not that we have to search for some name or manufacture one. Rather, we must follow the saintly persons and the &#347;&#257;stras in chanting His holy name.</P><P>Although the material and spiritual energies both belong to the Lord, He is impossible to understand as long as we are in the material energy. And when we come to the spiritual energy, He is very easy to know. As stated in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/7/23.htm">1.7.23</A>): m&#257;y&#257;m vyudasya cic-chakty&#257; kaivalye sthita &#257;tmani. Although the external energy belongs to the Lord, when one is in the external energy (mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;) He is very difficult to understand. However, when one comes to the spiritual energy, one can understand Him. Therefore in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/55.htm">18.55</A>) it is said, bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvatah: one who wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in reality must take to the platform of bhakti, or Krishna consciousness. This bhakti consists of various activities (&#347;ravanam k&#299;rtanam vishnoh smaranam p&#257;da-sevanam/ arcanam vandanam d&#257;syam sakhyam &#257;tma-nivedanam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../7/5/23.htm">SB 7.5.23</A>]), and to understand the Lord one must take to this path of devotional service. Even though the people of the world have forgotten God and may say that God is dead, this is not a fact. One can understand God when one takes to the Krishna consciousness movement, and thus one can be happy.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
