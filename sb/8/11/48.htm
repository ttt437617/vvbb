When he regained his senses and memory by the grace of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, he could understand everything that had happened. Therefore, although he had been defeated, he did not lament.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>It is significant that Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is here said to be very experienced. Although defeated, he was not at all sorry, for he knew that nothing can take place without the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since he was a devotee, he accepted his defeat without lamentation. As stated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/2/47.htm">2.47</A>), karmany ev&#257;dhik&#257;ras te m&#257; phaleshu kad&#257;cana. Everyone in Krishna consciousness should execute his duty, without regard for victory or defeat. One must execute his duty as ordered by Krishna or His representative, the spiritual master. &#256;nuk&#363;lyena krishn&#257;nu&#347;&#299;lanam bhaktir uttam&#257;. In first-class devotional service, one always abides by the orders and will of Krishna.</P><P>Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, entitled "King Indra Annihilates the Demons."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="../12/summary.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
