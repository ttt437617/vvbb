I merely endeavored to offer You obeisances, but nonetheless the attempt was as successful as those of pure devotees. The causeless mercy You have shown to me, a fallen demon, was never achieved even by the demigods or the leaders of the various planets.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>SB 8.23.3</B></A>: &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continued: After speaking in this way, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja offered his obeisances first to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, and then to Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva.

I think that such kindness has never been achieved even by Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva or the goddess of fortune, Lakshm&#299;, what to speak of other demigods or common people.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 8.23.7</B></A>: O supreme shelter of everyone, great personalities like Brahm&#257; enjoy their perfection simply by tasting the honey of rendering service at Your lotus feet.
