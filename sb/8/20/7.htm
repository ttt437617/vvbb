This is the evidence of history. So why not give up this insignificant land? What is the serious consideration against it?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was prepared to give everything to Lord Vishnu, and &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, being a professional priest, might have been anxiously waiting, doubting whether there had been any such instance in history in which one had given everything in charity. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, however, cited the tangible examples of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;ibi and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dadh&#299;ci, who had given up their lives for the benefit of the general public. Certainly one has attachment for everything material, especially one's land, but land and other possessions are forcibly taken away at the time of death, as stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (mrityuh sarva-hara&#347; c&#257;ham). The Lord personally appeared to Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to take away everything he had, and thus he was so fortunate that he could see the Lord face to face. Nondevotees, however, cannot see the Lord face to face; to such persons the Lord appears as death and takes away all their possessions by force. Under the circumstances, why should we not part with our possessions and deliver them to Lord Vishnu for His satisfaction? &#346;r&#299; C&#257;nakya Pandita says in this regard, san-nimitte varam ty&#257;go vin&#257;&#347;e niyate sati (C&#257;nakya-&#347;loka 36). Since our money and possessions do not last but will somehow or other be taken away, as long as they are in our possession it is better to use them for charity to a noble cause. Therefore Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja defied the order of his so-called spiritual master.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
