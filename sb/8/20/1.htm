How could he disobey the instruction of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, his spiritual master? It is the duty of such a sober personality as Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to abide by the orders of his spiritual master immediately, as his spiritual master had advised. But Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja also considered that &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya was no longer to be accepted as a spiritual master, for he had deviated from the duty of a spiritual master. According to &#347;&#257;stra, the duty of the guru is to take the disciple back home, back to Godhead. If he is unable to do so and instead hinders the disciple in going back to Godhead, he should not be a guru. Gurur na sa sy&#257;t (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/5/5/18.htm">5.5.18</A>). One should not become a guru if he cannot enable his disciple to advance in Krishna consciousness. The goal of life is to become a devotee of Lord Krishna so that one may be freed from the bondage of material existence (tyaktv&#257; deham punar janma naiti mam eti so 'rjuna [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/9.htm">Bg. 4.9</A>]). The spiritual master helps the disciple attain this stage by developing Krishna consciousness. Now &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya has advised Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to deny the promise to V&#257;manadeva. Under the circumstances, therefore, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja thought that there would be no fault if he disobeyed the order of his spiritual master. He deliberated on this point &#8212; should he refuse to accept the advise of his spiritual master, or should he independently do everything to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead? He took some time. Therefore it is said, t&#363;shn&#299;m bh&#363;tv&#257; kshanam rajann uv&#257;c&#257;vahito gurum. After deliberating on this point, he decided that Lord Vishnu should be pleased in all circumstances, even at the risk of ignoring the guru's advice to the contrary.</P><P>Anyone who is supposed to be a guru but who goes against the principle of vishnu-bhakti cannot be accepted as guru. If one has falsely accepted such a guru, one should reject him. Such a guru is described as follows (Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Udyoga 1<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/udyoga79/25">79.25</A>):</P><P>guror apy avaliptasya</P><P CLASS=n>k&#257;ry&#257;k&#257;ryam aj&#257;natah</P><P CLASS=n>utpatha-pratipannasya</P><P CLASS=n>parity&#257;go vidh&#299;yate</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; has advised that such a useless guru, a family priest acting as guru, should be given up, and that the proper, bona-fide guru should be accepted.</P><P>shat-karma-nipuno vipro</P><P CLASS=n>mantra-tantra-vi&#347;&#257;radah</P><P CLASS=n>avaishnavo gurur na sy&#257;d</P><P CLASS=n>vaishnavah &#347;vapaco guruh</P><P>"A scholarly br&#257;hmana expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vaishnava, but if a person born in a family of a lower caste is a Vaishnava, he can become a spiritual master."
