I also think that this religious principle is correct.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja's grave answer to &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya is meaningful. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya stressed that one's material means of livelihood and one's material reputation, sense gratification and economic development must continue properly. To see to this is the first duty of a man who is a householder, especially one who is interested in material affairs. If a religious principle does not affect one's material condition, it is to be accepted. At the present time, in this age of Kali, this idea is extremely prominent. No one is prepared to accept any religious principle if it hampers material prosperity. &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, being a person of this material world, did not know the principles of a devotee. A devotee is determined to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His full satisfaction. Anything that hampers such determination should certainly be rejected. This is the principle of bhakti. &#256;nuk&#363;lyasya sa&#324;kalpah pr&#257;tik&#363;lyasya varjanam (Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/22/100.htm">Madhya 22.100</A>). To perform devotional service, one must accept only that which is favorable and reject that which is unfavorable. Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had the opportunity to contribute everything he possessed to the lotus feet of Lord V&#257;manadeva, but &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya was putting forward a material argument to hamper this process of devotional service. Under the circumstances, Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja decided that such hindrances should certainly be avoided. In other words, he decided immediately to reject the advice of &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya and go on with his duty. Thus he gave all his possessions to Lord V&#257;manadeva.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
