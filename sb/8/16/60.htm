In other words, by performing this sacrifice one can perform all other sacrifices automatically. This is also acknowledged to be the best of all ritualistic ceremonies. O gentle lady, it is the essence of all austerities, and it is the process of giving charity and pleasing the supreme controller.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#256;r&#257;dhan&#257;n&#257;m sarvesh&#257;m vishnor &#257;r&#257;dhanam param. This is a statement made by Lord &#346;iva to P&#257;rvat&#299;. Worshiping Lord Vishnu is the supreme process of worship. And how Lord Vishnu is worshiped in this payo-vrata ceremony has now been fully described. The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Vishnu by varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma. The Vedic principles of four varnas and four &#257;&#347;ramas are meant for worship of Vishnu (vishnur &#257;r&#257;dhyate pums&#257;m n&#257;nyat tat-tosha-k&#257;ranam). The Krishna consciousness movement is also vishnu-&#257;r&#257;dhanam, or worship of Lord Vishnu, according to the age. The payo-vrata method of vishnu-&#257;r&#257;dhanam was enunciated long, long ago by Ka&#347;yapa Muni to his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, and the same process is bona fide on earth even now. Especially for this age of Kali, the process accepted by the Krishna consciousness movement is to open hundreds and thousands of Vishnu temples (temples of R&#257;dh&#257;-Krishna, Jagann&#257;tha, Balar&#257;ma, S&#299;t&#257;-R&#257;ma, Gaura-Nit&#257;i and so on). Performing prescribed worship in such temples of Vishnu and thus worshiping the Lord is as good as performing the payo-vrata ceremony recommended here. The payo-vrata ceremony is performed from the first to the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight of the moon, but in our Krishna consciousness movement Lord Vishnu is worshiped in every temple according to a schedule of twenty-four hours of engagement in performing k&#299;rtana, chanting the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra, offering palatable food to Lord Vishnu and distributing this food to Vaishnavas and others. These are authorized activities, and if the members of the Krishna consciousness movement stick to these principles, they will achieve the same result one gains by observing the payo-vrata ceremony. Thus the essence of all auspicious activities, such as performing yajña, giving in charity, observing vratas, and undergoing austerities, is included in the Krishna consciousness movement. The members of this movement should immediately and sincerely follow the processes already recommended. Of course, sacrifice is meant to please Lord Vishnu. Yajñaih sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-pr&#257;yair yajanti hi sumedhasah: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../11/5/32.htm">SB 11.5.32</A>] in Kali-yuga, those who are intelligent perform the sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-yajña. One should follow this process conscientiously.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="59.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="61.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
