I wonder whether there have been any discrepancies in following these principles.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 8.16.6</B></A>: I wonder whether because of being too attached to the members of your family, you failed to properly receive uninvited guests, who therefore were not welcomed and went away.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 8.16.7</B></A>: Homes from which guests go away without having been received even with an offering of a little water are like those holes in the field which are the homes of jackals.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 8.16.8</B></A>: O chaste and auspicious woman, when I left home for other places, were you in so much anxiety that you did not offer oblations of ghee into the fire?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 8.16.9</B></A>: By worshiping the fire and the br&#257;hmanas, a householder can achieve the desired goal of residing in the higher planets, for the sacrificial fire and the br&#257;hmanas are to be considered the mouth of Lord Vishnu, who is the Supersoul of all the demigods.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 8.16.10</B></A>: O great-minded lady, are all your sons faring well?

Because I always think of you, there is no possibility that any of the religious principles will be neglected.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 8.16.13</B></A>: O my lord, since you are a Praj&#257;pati and are personally my instructor in the principles of religion, where is the possibility that all my desires will not be fulfilled?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 8.16.14</B></A>: O son of Mar&#299;ci, because you are a great personality you are equal toward all the demons and demigods, who are born either from your body or from your mind and who possess one or another of the three qualities &#8212; sattva-guna, rajo-guna or tamo-guna. But although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, is equal toward all living entities, He is especially favorable to the devotees.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 8.16.15</B></A>: Therefore, most gentle lord, kindly favor your maidservant.

It is different from the spirit soul. Indeed, the spirit soul is completely different from the material elements from which the body is made. But because of bodily attachment, one is regarded as a husband or son. These illusory relationships are caused by misunderstanding.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 8.16.20</B></A>: My dear Aditi, engage in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the master of everything, who can subdue everyone's enemies, and who sits within everyone's heart.
