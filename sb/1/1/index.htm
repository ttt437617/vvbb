I meditate upon Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>SB 1.1.2</B></A>: Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;na propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bh&#257;gavatam, compiled by the great sage Vy&#257;sadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of Bh&#257;gavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>SB 1.1.3</B></A>: O expert and thoughtful men, relish &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 1.1.4</B></A>: Once, in a holy place in the forest of Naimish&#257;ranya, great sages headed by the sage &#346;aunaka assembled to perform a great thousand-year sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord and His devotees.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 1.1.5</B></A>: One day, after finishing their morning duties by burning a sacrificial fire and offering a seat of esteem to &#346;r&#299;la S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, the great sages made inquiries, with great respect, about the following matters.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 1.1.6</B></A>: The sages said: Respected S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, you are completely free from all vice. You are well versed in all the scriptures famous for religious life, and in the Pur&#257;nas and the histories as well, for you have gone through them under proper guidance and have also explained them.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 1.1.7</B></A>: Being the eldest learned Ved&#257;ntist, O S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, you are acquainted with the knowledge of Vy&#257;sadeva, who is the incarnation of Godhead, and you also know other sages who are fully versed in all kinds of physical and metaphysical knowledge.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 1.1.8</B></A>: And because you are submissive, your spiritual masters have endowed you with all the favors bestowed upon a gentle disciple. Therefore you can tell us all that you have scientifically learned from them.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 1.1.9</B></A>: Please, therefore, being blessed with many years, explain to us, in an easily understandable way, what you have ascertained to be the absolute and ultimate good for the people in general.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 1.1.10</B></A>: O learned one, in this iron age of Kali men have but short lives. They are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky and, above all, always disturbed.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 1.1.11</B></A>: There are many varieties of scriptures, and in all of them there are many prescribed duties, which can be learned only after many years of study in their various divisions. Therefore, O sage, please select the essence of all these scriptures and explain it for the good of all living beings, that by such instruction their hearts may be fully satisfied.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 1.1.12</B></A>: All blessings upon you, O S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;. You know for what purpose the Personality of Godhead appeared in the womb of Devak&#299; as the son of Vasudeva.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 1.1.13</B></A>: O S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, we are eager to learn about the Personality of Godhead and His incarnations. Please explain to us those teachings imparted by previous masters [&#257;c&#257;ryas], for one is uplifted both by speaking them and by hearing them.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 1.1.14</B></A>: Living beings who are entangled in the complicated meshes of birth and death can be freed immediately by even unconsciously chanting the holy name of Krishna, which is feared by fear personified.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 1.1.15</B></A>: O S&#363;ta, those great sages who have completely taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord can at once sanctify those who come in touch with them, whereas the waters of the Ganges can sanctify only after prolonged use.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 1.1.16</B></A>: Who is there, desiring deliverance from the vices of the age of quarrel, who is not willing to hear the virtuous glories of the Lord?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 1.1.17</B></A>: His transcendental acts are magnificent and gracious, and great learned sages like N&#257;rada sing of them. Please, therefore, speak to us, who are eager to hear about the adventures He performs in His various incarnations.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 1.1.18</B></A>: O wise S&#363;ta, please narrate to us the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Godhead's multi-incarnations. Such auspicious adventures and pastimes of the Lord, the supreme controller, are performed by His internal powers.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 1.1.19</B></A>: We never tire of hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, who is glorified by hymns and prayers.
