Such a person is never afraid of any place or person, not even of death. For him nothing is as important as the Supreme Lord, and thus he gives equal importance to heaven and hell. He knows well that both heaven and hell are creations of the Lord, and similarly life and death are different conditions of existence created by the Lord. But in all conditions and in all circumstances, remembrance of N&#257;r&#257;yana is essential. The n&#257;r&#257;yana-par&#257;yana practices this constantly. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit was such a pure devotee. He was wrongfully cursed by an inexperienced son of a br&#257;hmana, who was under the influence of Kali, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit took this to be sent by N&#257;r&#257;yana. He knew that N&#257;r&#257;yana (Lord Krishna) had saved him when he was burned in the womb of his mother, and if he were to be killed by a snake bite, it would also take place by the will of the Lord. The devotee never goes against the will of the Lord; anything sent by God is a blessing for the devotee. Therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit was neither afraid of nor bewildered by such things. That is the sign of a pure devotee of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
