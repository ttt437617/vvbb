He will be as irresistible as fire and as unsurpassable as the ocean.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In history there are two Arjunas. One is K&#257;rttav&#299;rya Arjuna, the King of Haihaya, and the other is the grandfather of the child. Both the Arjunas are famous for their bowmanship, and the child Par&#299;kshit is foretold to be equal to both of them, particularly in fighting. A short description of the P&#257;ndava Arjuna is given below:</P><P>P&#257;ndava Arjuna: The great hero of the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. He is the kshatriya son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;ndu. Queen Kunt&#299;dev&#299; could call for any one of the demigods, and thus she called Indra, and Arjuna was born by him. Arjuna is therefore a plenary part of the heavenly King Indra. He was born in the month of Phalguna (February-March), and therefore he is also called Phalguni. When he appeared as the son of Kunt&#299;, his future greatness was proclaimed by air messages, and all the important personalities from different parts of the universe, such as the demigods, the Gandharvas, the &#256;dityas (from the sun globe), the Rudras, the Vasus, the N&#257;gas, the different rishis (sages) of importance, and the Apsar&#257;s (the society girls of heaven), all attended the ceremony. The Apsar&#257;s pleased everyone by their heavenly dances and songs. Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krishna and the maternal uncle of Arjuna, sent his priest representative Ka&#347;yapa to purify Arjuna by all the prescribed samsk&#257;ras, or reformatory processes. His samsk&#257;ra of being given a name was performed in the presence of the rishis, residents of &#346;atasri&#324;ga. He married four wives, Draupad&#299;, Subhadr&#257;, Citra&#324;gada and Ul&#363;p&#299;, from whom he got four sons of the names &#346;rutak&#299;rti, Abhimanyu, Babhruv&#257;hana and Ir&#257;v&#257;n respectively.</P><P>During his student life he was entrusted to study under the great professor Dron&#257;c&#257;rya, along with other P&#257;ndavas and the Kurus. But he excelled everyone by his studious intensity, and Dron&#257;c&#257;rya was especially attracted by his disciplinary affection. Dron&#257;c&#257;rya accepted him as a first-grade scholar and loved heartily to bestow upon him all the blessings of military science. He was so ardent a student that he used to practice bowmanship even at night, and for all these reasons Professor Dron&#257;c&#257;rya was determined to make him the topmost bowman of the world. He passed very brilliantly the examination in piercing the target, and Dron&#257;c&#257;rya was very pleased. Royal families at Manipur and Tripura are descendants of Arjuna's son Babhruv&#257;hana. Arjuna saved Dron&#257;c&#257;rya from the attack of a crocodile, and the &#256;c&#257;rya, being pleased with him, rewarded him with a weapon of the name brahma&#347;ira. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada was inimical toward Dron&#257;c&#257;rya, and thus when he attacked the &#256;c&#257;rya, Arjuna got him arrested and brought him before Dron&#257;c&#257;rya. He besieged a city of the name Ahichhatra, belonging to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada, and after taking it over he gave it to Dron&#257;c&#257;rya. The confidential treatment of the weapon brahma&#347;ira was explained to Arjuna, and Dron&#257;c&#257;rya was promised by Arjuna that he would use the weapon if necessary when he (Dron&#257;c&#257;rya) personally became an enemy of Arjuna. By this, the &#256;c&#257;rya forecasted the future battle of Kurukshetra, in which Dron&#257;c&#257;rya was on the opposite side. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada, although defeated by Arjuna on behalf of his professor Dron&#257;c&#257;rya, decided to hand over his daughter Draupad&#299; to his young combatant, but he was disappointed when he heard the false news of Arjuna's death in the fire of a shellac house intrigued by Duryodhana. He therefore arranged for Draupad&#299;'s personal selection of a groom who could pierce the eye of a fish hanging on the ceiling. This trick was especially made because only Arjuna could do it, and he was successful in his desire to hand over his equally worthy daughter to Arjuna. Arjuna's brothers were at that time living incognito under agreement with Duryodhana, and Arjuna and his brothers attended the meeting of Draupad&#299;'s selection in the dress of br&#257;hmanas. When all the kshatriya kings assembled saw that a poor br&#257;hmana had been garlanded by Draupad&#299; for her lord, &#346;r&#299; Krishna disclosed his identity to Balar&#257;ma.</P><P>He met Ul&#363;p&#299; at Haridv&#257;ra (Hardwar), and he was attracted by a girl belonging to N&#257;galoka, and thus Irav&#257;n was born. Similarly, he met Citra&#324;gada, a daughter of the King of Manipura, and thus Babhruv&#257;hana was born. Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna made a plan to help Arjuna to kidnap Subhadr&#257;, sister of &#346;r&#299; Krishna, because Baladeva was inclined to hand her over to Duryodhana. Yudhishthira also agreed with &#346;r&#299; Krishna, and thus Subhadr&#257; was taken by force by Arjuna and then married to him. Subhadr&#257;'s son is Abhimanyu, the father of Par&#299;kshit Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the posthumous child. Arjuna satisfied the fire-god by setting fire to the Kh&#257;ndava Forest, and thus the fire-god gave him one weapon. Indra was angry when the fire was set in the Kh&#257;ndava Forest, and thus Indra, assisted by all other demigods, began fighting with Arjuna for his great challenge. They were defeated by Arjuna, and Indradeva returned to his heavenly kingdom. Arjuna also promised all protection to one May&#257;sura, and the latter presented him one valuable conchshell celebrated as the Devadatta. Similarly, he received many other valuable weapons from Indradeva when he was satisfied to see his chivalry.</P><P>When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira was disappointed in defeating the King of Magadha, Jar&#257;sandha, it was Arjuna only who gave King Yudhishthira all kinds of assurances, and thus Arjuna, Bh&#299;ma and Lord Krishna started for Magadha to kill Jar&#257;sandha. When he went out to bring all other kings of the world under the subjection of the P&#257;ndavas, as was usual after the coronation of every emperor, he conquered the country named Kelinda and brought in subjugation King Bhagdutt. Then he traveled through countries like Antagiri, Ulukpur and Modapur and brought under subjugation all the rulers.</P><P>Sometimes he underwent severe types of penances, and later on he was rewarded by Indradeva. Lord &#346;iva also wanted to try the strength of Arjuna, and in the form of an aborigine, Lord &#346;iva met him. There was a great fight between the two, and at last Lord &#346;iva was satisfied with him and disclosed his identity. Arjuna prayed to the lord in all humbleness, and the lord, being pleased with him, presented him the pa&#347;upata weapon. He acquired many other important weapons from different demigods. He received dand&#257;stra from Yamar&#257;ja, pa&#347;&#257;stra from Varuna, and antardhana-astra from Kuvera, the treasurer of the heavenly kingdom. Indra wanted him to come to the heavenly kingdom, the Indraloka planet beyond the moon planet. In that planet he was cordially received by the local residents, and he was awarded reception in the heavenly parliament of Indradeva. Then he met Indradeva, who not only presented him with his vajra weapon, but also taught him the military and musical science as used in the heavenly planet. In one sense, Indra is the real father of Arjuna, and therefore indirectly he wanted to entertain Arjuna with the famous society girl of heaven, Urva&#347;&#299;, the celebrated beauty. The society girls of heaven are lusty, and Urva&#347;&#299; was very eager to contact Arjuna, the strongest human being. She met him in his room and expressed her desires but Arjuna sustained his unimpeachable character by closing his eyes before Urva&#347;&#299;, addressing her as mother of the Kuru dynasty and placing her in the category of his mothers Kunt&#299;, M&#257;dr&#299; and &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299;, wife of Indradeva. Disappointed, Urva&#347;&#299; cursed Arjuna and left. In the heavenly planet he also met the great celebrated ascetic Lomasa and prayed to him for the protection of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira.</P><P>When his inimical cousin Duryodhana was under the clutches of the Gandharvas, he wanted to save him and requested the Gandharvas to release Duryodhana, but the Gandharvas refused, and thus he fought with them and got Duryodhana released. When all the P&#257;ndavas lived incognito, he presented himself in the court of King Vir&#257;ta as a eunuch and was employed as the musical teacher of Uttar&#257;, his future daughter-in-law, and was known in the Vir&#257;ta court as the Brihannala. As Brihannala, he fought on behalf of Uttara, the son of King Vir&#257;ta, and thus defeated the Kurus in the fight incognito. His secret weapons were safely kept in the custody of a somi tree, and he ordered Uttara to get them back. His identity and his brothers' identity were later on disclosed to Uttara. Dron&#257;c&#257;rya was informed of Arjuna's presence in the fight of the Kurus and the Vir&#257;tas. Later, on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra, Arjuna killed many great generals like Karna and others. After the Battle of Kurukshetra, he punished A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;, who had killed all the five sons of Draupad&#299;. Then all the brothers went to Bh&#299;shmadeva.</P><P>It is due to Arjuna only that the great philosophical discourses of the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; were again spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra. His wonderful acts on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra are vividly described in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata. Arjuna was defeated, however, by his son Babhruv&#257;hana at Manipura and fell unconscious when Ul&#363;p&#299; saved him. After the disappearance of Lord Krishna, the message was brought by Arjuna to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira. Again, Arjuna visited Dv&#257;rak&#257;, and all the widow wives of Lord Krishna lamented before him. He took them all in the presence of Vasudeva and pacified all of them. Later on, when Vasudeva passed away, he performed his funeral ceremony in the absence of Krishna. While Arjuna was taking all the wives of Krishna to Indraprastha, he was attacked on the way, and he could not protect the ladies in his custody. At last, advised by Vy&#257;sadeva, all the brothers headed for Mah&#257;prasthan. On the way, at the request of his brother, he gave up all important weapons as useless, and he dropped them all in the water.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
