Bhakti-yoga is considered by some to be another form of karma. But factually bhakti-yoga is above both karma and jñ&#257;na. Bhakti-yoga is independent of jñ&#257;na or karma; on the other hand, jñ&#257;na and karma are dependent on bhakti-yoga. This kriy&#257;-yoga or karma-yoga, as recommended by &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada to Vy&#257;sa, is specifically recommended because the principle is to satisfy the Lord. The Lord does not want His sons, the living beings, to suffer the threefold miseries of life. He desires that all of them come to Him and live with Him, but going back to Godhead means that one must purify himself from material infections. When work is performed, therefore, to satisfy the Lord, the performer becomes gradually purified from the material affection. This purification means attainment of spiritual knowledge. Therefore knowledge is dependent on karma, or work, done on behalf of the Lord. Other knowledge, being devoid of bhakti-yoga or satisfaction of the Lord, cannot lead one back to the kingdom of God, which means that it cannot even offer salvation, as already explained in connection with the stanza naishkarmyam apy acyuta-bh&#257;va-varjitam (&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam <A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/5/12.htm">1.5.12</A>). The conclusion is that a devotee engaged in the unalloyed service of the Lord, specifically in hearing and chanting of His transcendental glories, becomes simultaneously spiritually enlightened by the divine grace, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
