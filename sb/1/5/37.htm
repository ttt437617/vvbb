These are V&#257;sudeva, Sa&#324;karshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. V&#257;sudeva and Sa&#324;karshana are on the middle left and right, Pradyumna is on the right of Sa&#324;karshana, and Aniruddha is on the left of V&#257;sudeva, and thus the four Deities are situated. They are known as the four aides-de-camp of Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna.</P><P>This is a Vedic hymn or mantra beginning with omk&#257;ra pranava, and thus the mantra is established by the transcendental chanting process, namely, om namo dh&#299;mahi, etc.</P><P>The purport is that any transaction, either in the field of fruitive work or in empiric philosophy, which is not ultimately aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord, is considered to be useless. N&#257;radaj&#299; has therefore explained the nature of unalloyed devotional service by his personal experience in the development of intimacy between the Lord and the living entity by a gradual process of progressive devotional activities. Such a progressive march of transcendental devotion for the Lord culminates in the attainment of loving service of the Lord, which is called prem&#257; in different transcendental variegatedness called rasas (tastes). Such devotional service is also executed in mixed forms, namely mixed with fruitive work or empiric philosophical speculations.</P><P>Now the question which was raised by the great rishis headed by &#346;aunaka regarding the confidential part of S&#363;ta's achievement through the spiritual master is explained herein by the chanting of this hymn consisting of thirty-three letters. And this mantra is addressed to the four Deities, or the Lord with His plenary expansions. The central figure is Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna because the plenary portions are His aides-de-camp. The most confidential part of the instruction is that one should always chant and remember the glories of the Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with His different plenary portions expanded as V&#257;sudeva, Sa&#324;karshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Those expansions are the original Deities for all other truths, namely either vishnu-tattva or &#347;akti-tattvas.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
