This Brahma-s&#363;tra, or Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra, is meant for those who are already engaged in self-realization. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is so made that one becomes at once engaged in the path of self-realization simply by hearing the topics. Although it is especially meant for the paramahamsas, or those who are totally engaged in self-realization, it works into the depths of the hearts of those who may be worldly men. Worldly men are all engaged in sense gratification. But even such men will find in this Vedic literature a remedial measure for their material diseases. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a liberated soul from the very beginning of his birth, and his father taught him &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam. Amongst mundane scholars, there is some diversity of opinion as to the date of compilation of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam. It is, however, certain from the text of the Bh&#257;gavatam that it was compiled before the disappearance of King Par&#299;kshit and after the departure of Lord Krishna. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit was ruling the world as the King of Bh&#257;rata-varsha, he chastised the personality of Kali. According to revealed scriptures and astrological calculation, the age of Kali is in its five thousandth year. Therefore, &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam was compiled not less than five thousand years ago. Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata was compiled before &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, and the Pur&#257;nas were compiled before Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata. That is an estimation of the date of compilation of the different Vedic literatures. The synopsis of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam was given before the detailed description under instruction of N&#257;rada. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is the science for following the path of nivritti-m&#257;rga. The path of pravritti-m&#257;rga was condemned by N&#257;rada. That path is the natural inclination for all conditioned souls. The theme of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is the cure of the materialistic disease of the human being, or stopping completely the pangs of material existence.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
