Any historical fact old or new which has a connection with the activities of the Lord is to be understood as a transcendental narration of the Lord. Without Krishna, all the supplementary literatures like the Pur&#257;nas and Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata are simply stories or historical facts. But with Krishna they become transcendental, and when we hear of them we at once become transcendentally related with the Lord. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is also a Pur&#257;na, but the special significance of this Pur&#257;na is that the activities of the Lord are central and not just supplementary historical facts. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam is thus recommended by Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu as the spotless Pur&#257;na. There is a class of less intelligent devotees of the Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;na who desire to relish at once the activities of the Lord narrated in the Tenth Canto without first understanding the primary cantos. They are under the false impression that the other cantos are not concerned with Krishna, and thus more foolishly than intelligently they take to the reading of the Tenth Canto. These readers are specifically told herein that the other cantos of the Bh&#257;gavatam are as important as the Tenth Canto. No one should try to go into the matters of the Tenth Canto without having thoroughly understood the purport of the other nine cantos. Krishna and His pure devotees like the P&#257;ndavas are on the same plane. Krishna is not without His devotees of all the rasas, and the pure devotees like the P&#257;ndavas are not without Krishna. The devotees and the Lord are interlinked, and they cannot be separated. Therefore talks about them are all krishna-kath&#257;, or topics of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="13-14.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
