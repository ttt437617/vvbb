Seeing this, Bh&#299;shmadeva congratulated them with feeling. There were tears of ecstasy in his eyes, for he was overwhelmed by love and affection.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;ndu died, his sons were all small children, and naturally they were brought up under the affection of elderly members of the royal family, specifically by Bh&#299;shmadeva. Later on, when the P&#257;ndavas were grown up, they were cheated by cunning Duryodhana and company, and Bh&#299;shmadeva, although he knew that the P&#257;ndavas were innocent and were unnecessarily put into trouble, could not take the side of the P&#257;ndavas for political reasons. At the last stage of his life, when Bh&#299;shmadeva saw his most exalted grandsons, headed by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira, sitting very gently at his side, the great warrior-grandfather could not check his loving tears, which were automatically flowing from his eyes. He remembered the great tribulations suffered by his most pious grandsons. Certainly he was the most satisfied man because of Yudhishthira's being enthroned in place of Duryodhana, and thus he began to congratulate them.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
