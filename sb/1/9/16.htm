Even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The bewilderment of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira over his past sinful acts and the resultant sufferings, etc., is completely negated by the great authority Bh&#299;shma (one of the twelve authorized persons). Bh&#299;shma wanted to impress upon Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira that since time immemorial no one, including such demigods as &#346;iva and Brahm&#257;, could ascertain the real plan of the Lord. So what can we understand about it? It is useless also to inquire about it. Even the exhaustive philosophical inquiries of sages cannot ascertain the plan of the Lord. The best policy is simply to abide by the orders of the Lord without argument. The sufferings of the P&#257;ndavas were never due to their past deeds. The Lord had to execute the plan of establishing the kingdom of virtue, and therefore His own devotees suffered temporarily in order to establish the conquest of virtue. Bh&#299;shmadeva was certainly satisfied by seeing the triumph of virtue, and he was glad to see King Yudhishthira on the throne, although he himself fought against him. Even a great fighter like Bh&#299;shma could not win the Battle of Kurukshetra because the Lord wanted to show that vice cannot conquer virtue, regardless of who tries to execute it. Bh&#299;shmadeva was a great devotee of the Lord, but he chose to fight against the P&#257;ndavas by the will of the Lord because the Lord wanted to show that a fighter like Bh&#299;shma cannot win on the wrong side.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
