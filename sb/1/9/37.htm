He even dropped His outer garment on the way.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The Battle of Kurukshetra was fought on military principles but at the same time in a sporting spirit, like a friend's fight with another friend. Duryodhana criticized Bh&#299;shmadeva, alleging that he was reluctant to kill Arjuna because of paternal affection. A kshatriya cannot tolerate insults on the principle of fighting. Bh&#299;shmadeva therefore promised that the next day he would kill all five P&#257;ndavas with special weapons made for the purpose. Duryodhana was satisfied, and he kept the arrows with him to be delivered the next day during the fight. By tricks Arjuna took the arrows from Duryodhana, and Bh&#299;shmadeva could understand that this was the trick of Lord Krishna. So he took a vow that the next day Krishna would have to take up weapons Himself, otherwise His friend Arjuna would die. In the next day's fighting Bh&#299;shmadeva fought so violently that both Arjuna and Krishna were in trouble. Arjuna was almost defeated; the situation was so tense that he was about to be killed by Bh&#299;shmadeva the very next moment. At that time Lord Krishna wanted to please His devotee, Bh&#299;shma, by keeping Bh&#299;shma's promise, which was more important than His own. Seemingly He broke His own promise. He promised before the beginning of the Battle of Kurukshetra that He would remain without weapons and would not use His strength for either of the parties. But to protect Arjuna He got down from the chariot, took up the wheel of the chariot and hurriedly rushed at Bh&#299;shmadeva in an angry mood, as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He dropped His covering cloth on the way, and out of great anger He did not know that He had dropped it. Bh&#299;shmadeva at once gave up his weapons and stood to be killed by Krishna, his beloved Lord. The fighting of the day was thus ended at that very moment, and Arjuna was saved. Of course there was no possibility of Arjuna's death because the Lord Himself was on the chariot, but because Bh&#299;shmadeva wanted to see Lord Krishna take up some weapon to save His friend, the Lord created this situation, making Arjuna's death imminent. He stood before Bh&#299;shmadeva to show him that his promise was fulfilled and that He had taken up the wheel.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
