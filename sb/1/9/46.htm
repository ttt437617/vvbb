Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;ndu, the father of the five brothers headed by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira, had died, Bh&#299;shmadeva was the most affectionate grandfather of the P&#257;ndavas and caretaker of the widow daughter-in-law Kunt&#299;dev&#299;. Although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dhritar&#257;shtra, the elder uncle of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira, was there to look after them, his affection was more on the side of his hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana. Ultimately a colossal clique was fabricated to deprive the five fatherless brothers of the rightful claim of the kingdom of Hastin&#257;pura. There was great intrigue, common in imperial palaces, and the five brothers were exiled to the wilderness. But Bh&#299;shmadeva was always a sincerely sympathetic well-wisher, grandfather, friend and philosopher to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira, even up to the last moment of his life. He died very happily by seeing Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira to the throne, otherwise he would have long ago quitted his material body, instead of suffering agony over the undue sufferings of the P&#257;ndavas. He was simply waiting for the opportune moment because he was sure and certain that the sons of P&#257;ndu would come out victorious in the Battlefield of Kurukshetra, as His Lordship &#346;r&#299; Krishna was their protector. As a devotee of the Lord, he knew that the Lord's devotee cannot be vanquished at any time. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira was quite aware of all these good wishes of Bh&#299;shmadeva, and therefore he must have been feeling the great separation. He was sorry for the separation of a great soul, and not for the material body which Bh&#299;shmadeva relinquished. The funeral ceremony was a necessary duty, although Bh&#299;shmadeva was a liberated soul. Since Bh&#299;shmadeva was without issue, the eldest grandson, namely Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira, was the rightful person to perform this ceremony. It was a great boon to Bh&#299;shmadeva that an equally great son of the family undertook the last rites of a great man.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
