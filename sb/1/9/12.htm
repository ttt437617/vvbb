You did not deserve to remain alive under those tribulations, yet you were protected by the br&#257;hmanas, God and religion.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira was disturbed due to the great massacre in the Battle of Kurukshetra. Bh&#299;shmadeva could understand this, and therefore he spoke first of the terrible sufferings of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira. He was put into difficulty by injustice only, and the Battle of Kurukshetra was fought just to counteract this injustice. Therefore, he should not regret the great massacre. He wanted to point out particularly that they were always protected by the br&#257;hmanas, the Lord and religious principles. As long as they were protected by these three important items, there was no cause of disappointment. Thus Bh&#299;shmadeva encouraged Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira to dissipate his despondency. As long as a person is fully in cooperation with the wishes of the Lord, guided by the bona fide br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas and strictly following religious principles, one has no cause for despondency, however trying the circumstances of life. Bh&#299;shmadeva, as one of the authorities in the line, wanted to impress this point upon the P&#257;ndavas.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
