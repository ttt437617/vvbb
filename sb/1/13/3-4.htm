It so appeared that they had regained their consciousness after a long period.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299;: The ideal chaste lady in the history of the world. She was the daughter of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Subala, the King of G&#257;ndh&#257;ra (now Kandahar in Kabul), and in her maiden state she worshiped Lord &#346;iva. Lord &#346;iva is generally worshiped by Hindu maidens to get a good husband. G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; satisfied Lord &#346;iva, and by his benediction to obtain one hundred sons, she was betrothed to Dhritar&#257;shtra, despite his being blind forever. When G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; came to know that her would-be husband was a blind man, to follow her life companion she decided to become voluntarily blind. So she wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens, and she was married to Dhritar&#257;shtra under the guidance of her elder brother &#346;akuni. She was the most beautiful girl of her time, and she was equally qualified by her womanly qualities, which endeared every member of the Kaurava court. But despite all her good qualities, she had the natural frailties of a woman, and she was envious of Kunt&#299; when the latter gave birth to a male child. Both the queens were pregnant, but Kunt&#299; first gave birth to a male child. Thus G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; became angry and gave a blow to her own abdomen. As a result, she gave birth to a lump of flesh only, but since she was a devotee of Vy&#257;sadeva, by the instruction of Vy&#257;sadeva the lump was divided into one hundred parts, and each part gradually developed to become a male child. Thus her ambition to become the mother of one hundred sons was fulfilled, and she began to nourish all the children according to her exalted position. When the intrigue of the Battle of Kurukshetra was going on, she was not in favor of fighting with the P&#257;ndavas; rather, she blamed Dhritar&#257;shtra, her husband, for such a fratricidal war. She desired that the state be divided into two parts, for the sons of P&#257;ndu and her own. She was very affected when all her sons died in the Battle of Kurukshetra, and she wanted to curse Bh&#299;masena and Yudhishthira, but she was checked by Vy&#257;sadeva. Her mourning over the death of Duryodhana and Duh&#347;&#257;sana before Lord Krishna was very pitiful, and Lord Krishna pacified her by transcendental messages. She was equally aggrieved on the death of Karna, and she described to Lord Krishna the lamentation of Karna's wife. She was pacified by &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva when he showed her dead sons, then promoted to the heavenly kingdoms. She died along with her husband in the jungles of the Himalayas near the mouth of the Ganges; she burned in a forest fire. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira performed the death ceremony of his uncle and aunt.</P><P>Prith&#257;: Daughter of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#346;&#363;rasena and sister of Vasudeva, Lord Krishna's father. Later she was adopted by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Kuntibhoja, and hence she is known as Kunt&#299;. She is the incarnation of the success potency of the Personality of Godhead. The heavenly denizens from the upper planets used to visit the palace of King Kuntibhoja, and Kunt&#299; was engaged for their reception. She also served the great mystic sage Durv&#257;s&#257;, and being satisfied by her faithful service, Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni gave her a mantra by which it was possible for her to call for any demigod she pleased. As a matter of inquisitiveness, she at once called for the sun-god, who desired couplement with her, but she declined. But the sun-god assured her immunity from virgin adulteration, and so she agreed to his proposal. As a result of this couplement, she became pregnant, and Karna was born by her. By the grace of the sun, she again turned into a virgin girl, but being afraid of her parents, she quitted the newly born child, Karna. After that, when she actually selected her own husband, she preferred P&#257;ndu to be her husband. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;ndu later wanted to retire from family life and adopt the renounced order of life. Kunt&#299; refused to allow her husband to adopt such life, but at last Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;ndu gave her permission to become a mother of sons by calling some other suitable personalities. Kunt&#299; did not accept this proposal at first, but when vivid examples were set by P&#257;ndu she agreed. Thus by dint of the mantra awarded by Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni she called for Dharmar&#257;ja, and thus Yudhishthira was born. She called for the demigod V&#257;yu (air), and thus Bh&#299;ma was born. She called for Indra, the King of heaven, and thus Arjuna was born. The other two sons, namely Nakula and Sahadeva, were begotten by P&#257;ndu himself in the womb of M&#257;dr&#299;. Later on, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;ndu died at an early age, for which Kunt&#299; was so aggrieved that she fainted. Two co-wives, namely Kunt&#299; and M&#257;dr&#299;, decided that Kunt&#299; should live for the maintenance of the five minor children, the P&#257;ndavas, and M&#257;dr&#299; should accept the sat&#299; rituals by meeting voluntary death along with her husband. This agreement was endorsed by great sages like &#346;atasri&#324;ga and others present on the occasion.</P><P>Later on, when the P&#257;ndavas were banished from the kingdom by the intrigues of Duryodhana, Kunt&#299; followed her sons, and she equally faced all sorts of difficulties during those days. During the forest life one demon girl, Hidimb&#257;, wanted Bh&#299;ma as her husband. Bh&#299;ma refused, but when the girl approached Kunt&#299; and Yudhishthira, they ordered Bh&#299;ma to accept her proposal and give her a son. As a result of this combination, Ghatotkaca was born, and he fought very valiantly with his father against the Kauravas. In their forest life they lived with a br&#257;hmana family that was in trouble because of one Bak&#257;sura demon, and Kunt&#299; ordered Bh&#299;ma to kill the Bak&#257;sura to protect the br&#257;hmana family against troubles created by the demon. She advised Yudhishthira to start for the P&#257;ñc&#257;lade&#347;a. Draupad&#299; was gained in this P&#257;ñc&#257;lade&#347;a by Arjuna, but by order of Kunt&#299; all five of the P&#257;ndava brothers became equally the husbands of P&#257;ñc&#257;l&#299;, or Draupad&#299;. She was married with five P&#257;ndavas in the presence of Vy&#257;sadeva. Kunt&#299;dev&#299; never forgot her first child, Karna, and after Karna's death in the Battle of Kurukshetra she lamented and admitted before her other sons that Karna was her eldest son prior to her marriage with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;ndu. Her prayers for the Lord after the Battle of Kurukshetra, when Lord Krishna was going back home, are excellently explained. Later she went to the forest with G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; for severe penance. She used to take meals after each thirty days. She finally sat down in profound meditation and later burned to ashes in a forest fire.</P><P>Draupad&#299;: The most chaste daughter of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada and partly an incarnation of goddess &#346;ac&#299;, the wife of Indra. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada performed a great sacrifice under the superintendence of the sage Yaja. By his first offering, Dhrishtadyumna was born, and by the second offering, Draupad&#299; was born. She is therefore the sister of Dhrishtadyumna, and she is also named P&#257;ñc&#257;l&#299;. The five P&#257;ndavas married her as a common wife, and each of them begot a son in her. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira begot a son named Pratibhit, Bh&#299;masena begot a son named Sutasoma, Arjuna begot &#346;rutak&#299;rti, Nakula begot &#346;at&#257;n&#299;ka, and Sahadeva begot &#346;rutakarm&#257;. She is described as a most beautiful lady, equal to her mother-in-law, Kunt&#299;. During her birth there was an aeromessage that she should be called Krishn&#257;. The same message also declared that she was born to kill many a kshatriya. By dint of her blessings from &#346;a&#324;kara, she was awarded five husbands, equally qualified. When she preferred to select her own husband, princes and kings were invited from all the countries of the world. She was married with the P&#257;ndavas during their exile in the forest, but when they went back home Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Drupada gave them immense wealth as a dowry. She was well received by all the daughters-in-law of Dhritar&#257;shtra. When she was lost in a gambling game, she was forcibly dragged into the assembly hall, and an attempt was made by Duh&#347;&#257;sana to see her naked beauty, even though there were elderly persons like Bh&#299;shma and Drona present. She was a great devotee of Lord Krishna, and by her praying, the Lord Himself became an unlimited garment to save her from the insult. A demon of the name Jat&#257;sura kidnapped her, but her second husband, Bh&#299;masena, killed the demon and saved her. She saved the P&#257;ndavas from the curse of Maharshi Durv&#257;s&#257; by the grace of Lord Krishna. When the P&#257;ndavas lived incognito in the palace of Vir&#257;ta, K&#299;caka was attracted by her exquisite beauty, and by arrangement with Bh&#299;ma the devil was killed and she was saved. She was very much aggrieved when her five sons were killed by A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;. At the last stage, she accompanied her husband Yudhishthira and others and fell on the way. The cause of her falling was explained by Yudhishthira, but when Yudhishthira entered the heavenly planet he saw Draupad&#299; gloriously present there as the goddess of fortune in the heavenly planet.</P><P>Subhadr&#257;: Daughter of Vasudeva and sister of Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna. She was not only a very dear daughter of Vasudeva, but also a very dear sister to both Krishna and Baladeva. The two brothers and sister are represented in the famous Jagann&#257;tha temple of Pur&#299;, and the temple is still visited by thousands of pilgrims daily. This temple is in remembrance of the Lord's visit at Kurukshetra during an occasion of solar eclipse and His subsequent meeting with the residents of Vrind&#257;vana. The meeting of R&#257;dh&#257; and Krishna during this occasion is a very pathetic story, and Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya, in the ecstasy of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;, always pined for Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna at Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299;. While Arjuna was at Dv&#257;rak&#257;, he wanted to have Subhadr&#257; as his queen, and he expressed his desire to Lord Krishna. &#346;r&#299; Krishna knew that His elder brother, Lord Baladeva, was arranging her marriage elsewhere, and since He did not dare to go against the arrangement of Baladeva, He advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadr&#257;. So when all of them were on a pleasure trip on the Raivata Hill, Arjuna managed to kidnap Subhadr&#257; according to the plan of &#346;r&#299; Krishna. &#346;r&#299; Baladeva was very angry at Arjuna, and He wanted to kill him, but Lord Krishna implored His brother to excuse Arjuna. Then Subhadr&#257; was duly married with Arjuna, and Abhimanyu was born of Subhadr&#257;. At the premature death of Abhimanyu, Subhadr&#257; was very mortified, but on the birth of Par&#299;kshit she was happy and solaced.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
