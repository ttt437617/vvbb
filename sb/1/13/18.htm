Do not delay. Just see how fear has overtaken you.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Cruel death cares for no one, be he Dhritar&#257;shtra or even Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira; therefore spiritual instruction, as was given to old Dhritar&#257;shtra, was equally applicable to younger Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira. As a matter of fact, everyone in the royal palace, including the King and his brothers and mother, was raptly attending the lectures. But it was known to Vidura that his instructions were especially meant for Dhritar&#257;shtra, who was too materialistic. The word r&#257;jan is especially addressed to Dhritar&#257;shtra significantly. Dhritar&#257;shtra was the eldest son of his father, and therefore according to law he was to be installed on the throne of Hastin&#257;pura. But because he was blind from birth, he was disqualified from his rightful claim. But he could not forget the bereavement, and his disappointment was somewhat compensated after the death of P&#257;ndu, his younger brother. His younger brother left behind him some minor children, and Dhritar&#257;shtra became the natural guardian of them, but at heart he wanted to become the factual king and hand the kingdom over to his own sons, headed by Duryodhana. With all these imperial ambitions, Dhritar&#257;shtra wanted to become a king, and he contrived all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his brother-in-law &#346;akuni. But everything failed by the will of the Lord, and at the last stage, even after losing everything, men and money, he wanted to remain as king, being the eldest uncle of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira, as a matter of duty, maintained Dhritar&#257;shtra in royal honor, and Dhritar&#257;shtra was happily passing away his numbered days in the illusion of being a king or the royal uncle of King Yudhishthira. Vidura, as a saint and as the duty-bound affectionate youngest brother of Dhritar&#257;shtra, wanted to awaken Dhritar&#257;shtra from his slumber of disease and old age. Vidura therefore sarcastically addressed Dhritar&#257;shtra as the "King," which he was actually not. Everyone is the servant of eternal time, and therefore no one can be king in this material world. King means the person who can order. The celebrated English king wanted to order time and tide, but the time and tide refused to obey his order. Therefore one is a false king in the material world, and Dhritar&#257;shtra was particularly reminded of this false position and of the factual fearful happenings which had already approached him at that time. Vidura asked him to get out immediately, if he wanted to be saved from the fearful situation which was approaching him fast. He did not ask Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira in that way because he knew that a king like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira is aware of all the fearful situations of this flimsy world and would take care of himself, in due course, even though Vidura might not be present at that time.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
