My uncle Dhritar&#257;shtra was also very mortified due to the death of all his sons and grandsons. Undoubtedly I am very ungrateful. Did he, therefore, take my offenses very seriously and, along with his wife, drown himself in the Ganges?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The P&#257;ndavas, especially Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira and Arjuna, anticipated the aftereffects of the Battle of Kurukshetra, and therefore Arjuna declined to execute the fighting. The fight was executed by the will of the Lord, but the effects of family aggrievement, as they had thought of it before, had come to be true. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira was always conscious of the great plight of his uncle Dhritar&#257;shtra and aunt G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299;, and therefore he took all possible care of them in their old age and aggrieved conditions. When, therefore, he could not find his uncle and aunt in the palace, naturally his doubts arose, and he conjectured that they had gone down to the water of the Ganges. He thought himself ungrateful because when the P&#257;ndavas were fatherless, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dhritar&#257;shtra had given them all royal facilities to live, and in return he had killed all Dhritar&#257;shtra's sons in the Battle of Kurukshetra. As a pious man, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira took into account all his unavoidable misdeeds, and he never thought of the misdeeds of his uncle and company. Dhritar&#257;shtra had suffered the effects of his own misdeeds by the will of the Lord, but Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira was thinking only of his own unavoidable misdeeds. That is the nature of a good man and devotee of the Lord. A devotee never finds fault with others, but tries to find his own and thus rectify them as far as possible.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
