In that holy place are our friends and well-wishers, the descendants of Yadu, who are always rapt in the service of the Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna. You might have seen them or heard about them. Are they all living happily in their abodes?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The particular word krishna-devat&#257;h, i.e., those who are always rapt in the service of Lord Krishna, is significant. The Y&#257;davas and the P&#257;ndavas, who were always rapt in the thought of the Lord Krishna and His different transcendental activities, were all pure devotees of the Lord like Vidura. Vidura left home in order to devote himself completely to the service of the Lord, but the P&#257;ndavas and the Y&#257;davas were always rapt in the thought of Lord Krishna. Thus there is no difference in their pure devotional qualities. Either remaining at home or leaving home, the real qualification of a pure devotee is to become rapt in the thought of Krishna favorably, i.e., knowing well that Lord Krishna is the Absolute Personality of Godhead. Kamsa, Jar&#257;sandha, &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la and other demons like them were also always rapt in the thought of Lord Krishna, but they were absorbed in a different way, namely unfavorably, or thinking Him to be a powerful man only. Therefore, Kamsa and &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la are not on the same level as pure devotees like Vidura, the P&#257;ndavas and the Y&#257;davas.</P><P>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira was also always rapt in the thought of Lord Krishna and His associates at Dv&#257;rak&#257;. Otherwise he could not have asked all about them from Vidura. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira was therefore on the same level of devotion as Vidura, although engaged in the state affairs of the kingdom of the world.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
