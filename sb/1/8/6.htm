The comparison of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira to the King of heaven is significant. The King of heaven is thousands and thousands of times greater than Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira in opulence, yet the fame of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira was not less. The reason is that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira was a pure devotee of the Lord, and by His grace only was King Yudhishthira on the level of the King of heaven, even though he performed only three yajñas whereas the King of heaven performed hundreds. That is the prerogative of the devotee of the Lord. The Lord is equal to everyone, but a devotee of the Lord is more glorified because he is always in touch with the all-great. The sun rays are equally distributed, but still there are some places which are always dark. This is not due to the sun but to the receptive power. Similarly, those who are cent percent devotees of the Lord get the full-fledged mercy of the Lord, which is always equally distributed everywhere.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
