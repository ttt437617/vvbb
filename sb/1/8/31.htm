And You were afraid, though fear personified is afraid of You. This sight is bewildering to me.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Here is another explanation of the bewilderment created by the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the Supreme in all circumstances, as already explained. Here is a specific example of the Lord's being the Supreme and at the same time a plaything in the presence of His pure devotee. The Lord's pure devotee renders service unto the Lord out of unalloyed love only, and while discharging such devotional service the pure devotee forgets the position of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord also accepts the loving service of His devotees more relishably when the service is rendered spontaneously out of pure affection, without anything of reverential admiration. Generally the Lord is worshiped by the devotees in a reverential attitude, but the Lord is meticulously pleased when the devotee, out of pure affection and love, considers the Lord to be less important than himself. The Lord's pastimes in the original abode of Goloka Vrind&#257;vana are exchanged in that spirit. The friends of Krishna consider Him one of them. They do not consider Him to be of reverential importance. The parents of the Lord (who are all pure devotees) consider Him a child only. The Lord accepts the chastisements of the parents more cheerfully than the prayers of the Vedic hymns. Similarly, He accepts the reproaches of His fiancees more palatably than the Vedic hymns. When Lord Krishna was present in this material world to manifest His eternal pastimes of the transcendental realm of Goloka Vrind&#257;vana as an attraction for the people in general, He displayed a unique picture of subordination before His foster mother, Ya&#347;od&#257;. The Lord, in His naturally childish playful activities, used to spoil the stocked butter of mother Ya&#347;od&#257; by breaking the pots and distributing the contents to His friends and playmates, including the celebrated monkeys of Vrind&#257;vana, who took advantage of the Lord's munificence. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; saw this, and out of her pure love she wanted to make a show of punishment for her transcendental child. She took a rope and threatened the Lord that she would tie Him up, as is generally done in the ordinary household. Seeing the rope in the hands of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, the Lord bowed down His head and began to weep just like a child, and tears rolled down His cheeks, washing off the black ointment smeared about His beautiful eyes. This picture of the Lord is adored by Kunt&#299;dev&#299; because she is conscious of the Lord's supreme position. He is feared often by fear personified, yet He is afraid of His mother, who wanted to punish Him just in an ordinary manner. Kunt&#299; was conscious of the exalted position of Krishna, whereas Ya&#347;od&#257; was not. Therefore Ya&#347;od&#257;'s position was more exalted than Kunt&#299;'s. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; got the Lord as her child, and the Lord made her forget altogether that her child was the Lord Himself. If mother Ya&#347;od&#257; had been conscious of the exalted position of the Lord, she would certainly have hesitated to punish the Lord. But she was made to forget this situation because the Lord wanted to make a complete gesture of childishness before the affectionate Ya&#347;od&#257;. This exchange of love between the mother and the son was performed in a natural way, and Kunt&#299;, remembering the scene, was bewildered, and she could do nothing but praise the transcendental filial love. Indirectly mother Ya&#347;od&#257; is praised for her unique position of love, for she could control even the all-powerful Lord as her beloved child.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
