And now You have saved us from the weapon of A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The list of dangerous encounters is submitted herein. Devak&#299; was once put into difficulty by her envious brother, otherwise she was well. But Kunt&#299;dev&#299; and her sons were put into one difficulty after another for years and years together. They were put into trouble by Duryodhana and his party due to the kingdom, and each and every time the sons of Kunt&#299; were saved by the Lord. Once Bh&#299;ma was administered poison in a cake, once they were put into the house made of shellac and set afire, and once Draupad&#299; was dragged out, and attempts were made to insult her by stripping her naked in the vicious assembly of the Kurus. The Lord saved Draupad&#299; by supplying an immeasurable length of cloth, and Duryodhana's party failed to see her naked. Similarly, when they were exiled in the forest, Bh&#299;ma had to fight with the man-eater demon Hidimb&#257; R&#257;kshasa, but the Lord saved him. So it was not finished there. After all these tribulations, there was the great Battle of Kurukshetra, and Arjuna had to meet such great generals as Drona, Bh&#299;shma and Karna, all powerful fighters. And at last, even when everything was done away with, there was the brahm&#257;stra released by the son of Dron&#257;c&#257;rya to kill the child within the womb of Uttar&#257;, and so the Lord saved the only surviving descendant of the Kurus, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
