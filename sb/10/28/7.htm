Therefore, please forgive us.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The word ayam, "this one here," clearly indicates that Krishna's father, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, was present as Varuna was speaking. In fact, Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura states that Varuna had seated &#346;r&#299; Nanda on a jeweled throne and had personally worshiped him out of respect.</P><P>Technically, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was correct in entering the water just before sunrise. The following explanation is given by &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; in his commentary on the first verse of this chapter: After an especially short Ek&#257;da&#347;&#299;, measuring only eighteen hours, about six hours of the lunar day in which the fast had to be broken, namely the Dv&#257;da&#347;&#299;, had already expired before the dawn. Since at sunrise the proper time for breaking the fast would have passed, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja decided to enter the water at an otherwise inauspicious time.</P><P>Of course, Varuna's servant should have been aware of these technical details, which are meant for strict followers of the Vedic rituals. Above and beyond that, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was acting as the Supreme Lord's father and was therefore a most sacred person, beyond the touch of insignificant cosmic bureaucrats like the foolish servant of Varuna.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
