Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu, who is situated in the core of everyone's heart, appeared from the heart of Devak&#299; in the dense darkness of night, like the full moon rising on the eastern horizon, because Devak&#299; was of the same category as &#346;r&#299; Krishna.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>As stated in the Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/37.htm">5.37</A>):</P><P>&#257;nanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibh&#257;vit&#257;bhis</P><P CLASS=n>t&#257;bhir ya eva nija-r&#363;patay&#257; kal&#257;bhih</P><P CLASS=n>goloka eva nivasaty akhil&#257;tma-bh&#363;to</P><P CLASS=n>govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi</P><P>This verse indicates that Krishna and His entourage are of the same spiritual potency (&#257;nanda-cinmaya-rasa). Krishna's father, His mother, His friends the cowherd boys, and the cows are all expansions of Krishna, as will be explained in the brahma-vimohana-l&#299;l&#257;. When Brahm&#257; took away Krishna's associates to test the supremacy of Lord Krishna, the Lord expanded Himself again in the forms of the many cowherd boys and calves, all of whom, as Brahm&#257; saw, were vishnu-m&#363;rtis. Devak&#299; is also an expansion of Krishna, and therefore this verse says, devaky&#257;m deva-r&#363;piny&#257;m vishnuh sarva-guh&#257;-&#347;ayah.</P><P>At the time for the Lord's appearance, the great sages and the demigods, being pleased, began to shower flowers. At the seashore, there was the sound of mild waves, and above the sea there were clouds in the sky which began to thunder very pleasingly.</P><P>When things were adjusted like this, Lord Vishnu, who is residing within the heart of every living entity, appeared in the darkness of night as the Supreme Personality of Godhead before Devak&#299;, who appeared as one of the demigoddesses. The appearance of Lord Vishnu at that time could be compared to the rising of the full moon in the sky on the eastern horizon. The objection may be raised that since Lord Krishna appeared on the eighth day of the waning moon, there could be no rising of the full moon. In answer to this it may be said that Lord Krishna appeared in the dynasty which is in the hierarchy of the moon; therefore, although the moon was incomplete on that night, because of the Lord's appearance in the dynasty wherein the moon is himself the original person, the moon was in an overjoyous condition, so by the grace of Krishna he could appear as a full moon. To welcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the waning moon became a full moon in jubilation.</P><P>Instead of deva-r&#363;piny&#257;m, some texts of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam clearly say vishnu-r&#363;piny&#257;m. In either case, the meaning is that Devak&#299; has the same spiritual form as the Lord. The Lord is sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>], and Devak&#299; is also sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha. Therefore no one can find any fault in the way the Supreme Personality of Godhead, sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha, appeared from the womb of Devak&#299;.</P><P>Those who are not in full knowledge that the appearance and disappearance of the Lord are transcendental (janma karma ca me divyam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/9.htm">Bg. 4.9</A>]) are sometimes surprised that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can take birth like an ordinary child. Actually, however, the Lord's birth is never ordinary. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is already situated within the core of everyone's heart as antary&#257;m&#299;, the Supersoul. Thus because He was present in full potency in Devak&#299;'s heart, He was also able to appear outside her body.</P><P>One of the twelve great personalities is Bh&#299;shmadeva (svayambh&#363;r n&#257;radah &#347;ambhuh kum&#257;rah kapilo manuh prahl&#257;da, janako bh&#299;shmah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../6/3/20.htm">SB 6.3.20</A>]). In &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/9/42.htm">1.9.42</A>), Bh&#299;shma, a great authority to be followed by devotees, says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in the core of everyone's heart, just as the sun may be on everyone's head. Yet although the sun may be on the heads of millions and millions of people, this does not mean that the sun is variously situated. Similarly, because the Supreme Personality of Godhead has inconceivable potencies, He can be within everyone's heart and yet not be situated variously. Ekatvam anupa&#347;yatah (&#298;&#347;opanishad 7). The Lord is one, but He can appear in everyone's heart by His inconceivable potency. Thus although the Lord was within the heart of Devak&#299;, He appeared as her child. According to the Vishnu Pur&#257;na, therefore, as quoted in the Vaishnava-toshan&#299;, the Lord appeared like the sun (anugrah&#257;saya). The Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/35.htm">5.35</A>) confirms that the Lord is situated even within the atom (and&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;nu-cay&#257;ntara-stham). He is situated in Mathur&#257;, in Vaikuntha and in the core of the heart. Therefore one should clearly understand that He did not live like an ordinary child in the heart or the womb of Devak&#299;. Nor did He appear like an ordinary human child, although He seemed to do so in order to bewilder asuras like Kamsa. I he asuras wrongly think that Krishna took birth like an ordinary child and passed away from this world like an ordinary man. Such asuric conceptions are rejected by persons in knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ajo 'pi sann avyay&#257;tm&#257; bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m &#299;&#347;varo 'pi san (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/6.htm">Bg. 4.6</A>). As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, the Lord is aja, unborn, and He is the supreme controller of everything. Nonetheless, He appeared as the child of Devak&#299;. This verse describes the inconceivable potency of the Lord, who appeared like the full moon. Understanding the special significance of the appearance of the Supreme Godhead, one should never regard Him as having taken birth like an ordinary child.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="9-10.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
