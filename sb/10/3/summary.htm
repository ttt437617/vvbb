Because they were afraid of Kamsa, when the Lord appeared as an ordinary child they took Him to Gokula, the home of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja.</P><P>Mother Devak&#299;, being fully transcendental, sac-cid-&#257;nanda, does not belong to this material world. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared with four hands, as if born from her womb. Upon seeing the Lord in that Vishnu form, Vasudeva was struck with wonder, and in transcendental happiness he and Devak&#299; mentally gave ten thousand cows in charity to the br&#257;hmanas. Vasudeva then offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the Supreme Person, Parabrahman, the Supersoul, who is beyond duality and who is internally and externally all-pervading. The Lord, the cause of all causes, is beyond material existence, although He is the creator of this material world. When He enters this world as Param&#257;tm&#257;, He is all-pervading (and&#257;ntara-stha-param&#257;nu-cay&#257;ntara-stham), yet He is transcendentally situated. For the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material world, the Lord appears as the guna-avat&#257;ras &#8212; Brahm&#257;, Vishnu and Mahe&#347;vara. Thus Vasudeva offered prayers full of meaning to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devak&#299; followed her husband by offering prayers describing the transcendental nature of the Lord. Fearing Kamsa and desiring that the Lord not be understood by atheistic and materialistic nondevotees, she prayed that the Lord withdraw His transcendental four-armed form and appear like an ordinary child with two hands.</P><P>The Lord reminded Vasudeva and Devak&#299; of two other incarnations in which He had appeared as their son. He had appeared as Pri&#347;nigarbha and V&#257;manadeva, and now this was the third time He was appearing as the son of Devak&#299; to fulfill their desire. The Lord then decided to leave the residence of Vasudeva and Devak&#299;, in the prison house of Kamsa, and at this very time, Yogam&#257;y&#257; took birth as the daughter of Ya&#347;od&#257;. By the arrangement of Yogam&#257;y&#257;, Vasudeva was able to leave the prison house and save the child from the hands of Kamsa. When Vasudeva brought Krishna to the house of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, he saw that by Yogam&#257;y&#257;'s arrangement, Ya&#347;od&#257;, as well as everyone else, was deeply asleep. Thus he exchanged the babies, taking Yogam&#257;y&#257; from Ya&#347;od&#257;'s lap and placing Krishna there instead. Then Vasudeva returned to his own place, having taken Yogam&#257;y&#257; as his daughter. He placed Yogam&#257;y&#257; on Devak&#299;'s bed and prepared to be a prisoner as before. In Gokula, Ya&#347;od&#257; could not understand whether she had given birth to a male or a female child.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../2/42.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1-5.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
