After He consoled them, they expressed to Him their deep feelings of ecstasy.</P><P>The gop&#299;s having shown in various ways their great eagerness to see Krishna, the attractor of Cupid, He appeared before them wearing silken yellow garments and a beautiful flower garland. Some of the gop&#299;s, overwhelmed with ecstasy at seeing Him, grasped His hands, others placed His arm on their shoulders, and others accepted the remnants of betel nut He had chewed. Thus they served Him.</P><P>One gop&#299;, impelled by loving anger toward Krishna, bit her lip and looked askance at Him. Because the gop&#299;s were so attached to Krishna, they were not satiated even by continuously gazing at Him. One of them then placed Krishna within her heart, closed her eyes and, embracing Him within herself again and again, became absorbed in transcendental bliss, just like a yog&#299;. In this way the pain the gop&#299;s had felt because of separation from the Lord was dispelled.</P><P>Next Lord Krishna went to the bank of the Yamun&#257; in the company of the cowherd girls, His internal potencies. The gop&#299;s then made a seat for Krishna out of their shawls, and after He had sat down they enjoyed with Him by gesturing amorously. The gop&#299;s still felt hurt that Krishna had disappeared, so He explained to them why He had done so. He further told them that He had come under the exclusive control of their loving devotion and would ever remain indebted to them.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../31/19.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
