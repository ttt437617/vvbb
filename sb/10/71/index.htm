Thus, in my opinion, conquering Jar&#257;sandha will serve both purposes.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 10.71.4</B></A>: By this decision there will be great gain for us, and You will save the kings. Thus, Govinda, You will be glorified.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 10.71.5</B></A>: The invincible King Jar&#257;sandha is as strong as ten thousand elephants. Indeed, other powerful warriors cannot defeat him. Only Bh&#299;ma is equal to him in strength.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 10.71.6</B></A>: He will be defeated in a match of single chariots, not when he is with his hundred military divisions. Now, Jar&#257;sandha is so devoted to brahminical culture that he never refuses requests from br&#257;hmanas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 10.71.7</B></A>: Bh&#299;ma should go to him disguised as a br&#257;hmana and beg charity. Thus he will obtain single combat with Jar&#257;sandha, and in Your presence Bh&#299;ma will no doubt kill him.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 10.71.8</B></A>: Even Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva act only as Your instruments in cosmic creation and annihilation, which are ultimately done by You, the Supreme Lord, in Your invisible aspect of time.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 10.71.9</B></A>: In their homes, the godly wives of the imprisoned kings sing of Your noble deeds &#8212; about how You will kill their husbands' enemy and deliver them. The gop&#299;s also sing Your glories &#8212; how You killed the enemy of the elephant king, Gajendra; the enemy of S&#299;ta, daughter of Janaka; and the enemies of Your own parents as well. So also do the sages who have obtained Your shelter glorify You, as do we ourselves.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 10.71.10</B></A>: O Krishna, the killing of Jar&#257;sandha, which is certainly a reaction of his past sins, will bring immense benefit.

It flew a flag marked with the emblem of Garuda.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 10.71.14</B></A>: As the vibrations resounding from mrida&#324;gas, bher&#299;s, kettledrums, conchshells and gomukhas filled the sky in all directions, Lord Krishna set out on His journey.

Their conveyances were fully loaded with grass tents, blankets, clothes and other items for the trip.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 10.71.17</B></A>: The Lord's army boasted royal umbrellas, c&#257;mara fans and huge flagpoles with waving banners.

All of N&#257;rada's senses were satisfied by his meeting with Lord Krishna. Thus, having heard the decision of the Lord and having been worshiped by Him, N&#257;rada placed Him firmly within his heart and departed through the sky.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 10.71.19</B></A>: With pleasing words the Lord addressed the messenger sent by the kings: "My dear messenger, I wish all good fortune to you.

Accompanied by his priests and dear associates, the King came out to meet Lord Krishna.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>SB 10.71.24</B></A>: As songs and musical instruments resounded along with the loud vibration of Vedic hymns, the King went forth with great reverence to meet Lord Hrish&#299;ke&#347;a, just as the senses go forth to meet the consciousness of life.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm"><B>SB 10.71.25</B></A>: The heart of King Yudhishthira melted with affection when he saw his dearmost friend, Lord Krishna, after such a long separation, and he embraced the Lord again and again.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>SB 10.71.26</B></A>: The eternal form of Lord Krishna is the everlasting residence of the goddess of fortune. As soon as King Yudhishthira embraced Him, the King became free of all the contamination of material existence. He immediately felt transcendental bliss and merged in an ocean of happiness. There were tears in his eyes, and his body shook due to ecstasy.
