This chapter describes how Kamsa, frightened by hearing an omen about his being killed by the eighth son of Devak&#299;, killed Devak&#299;'s sons one after another.</P><P>When &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; finished describing the dynasty of Yadu, as well as the dynasties of the moon-god and sun-god, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit requested him to describe Lord Krishna, who appeared with Baladeva in the Yadu dynasty, and how Krishna performed His activities within this world. Krishna is transcendental, the King said, and therefore to understand His activities is the occupation of liberated persons. Hearing of krishna-l&#299;l&#257; is the boat by which to achieve the ultimate goal of life. Except for an animal killer or one who is following a policy of suicide, every intelligent person must strive to understand Krishna and His activities.</P><P>Krishna was the only worshipable Deity for the P&#257;ndavas. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit was in the womb of his mother, Uttar&#257;, Krishna saved him from the attack of the brahma-&#347;astra. Now Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit asked &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; how His Lordship Baladeva, the son of Rohin&#299;, could have appeared in the womb of Devak&#299;. Why did Krishna transfer Himself from Mathur&#257; to Vrind&#257;vana, King Par&#299;kshit asked, and how did He live there with His family members? What did Krishna do in Mathur&#257; and Vrind&#257;vana, and why did He kill His maternal uncle Kamsa? For how many years did Krishna reside in Dv&#257;rak&#257;, and how many queens did He have? Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit asked &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; all these questions. He also requested &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; to describe other activities of Krishna about which he could not inquire.</P><P>When &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; began to speak about Krishna consciousness, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit forgot the fatigue brought about by his fasting. Enthusiastic to describe Krishna, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said, "Like the waters of the Ganges, descriptions of the activities of Krishna can purify the entire universe. The speaker, the inquirer and the audience all become purified."</P><P>Once when the entire world was overburdened by the increasing military power of demons in the form of kings, mother earth assumed the shape of a cow and approached Lord Brahm&#257; for relief, Sympathetic to mother earth's lamentation, Brahm&#257;, accompanied by Lord &#346;iva and other demigods, took the cow-shaped mother earth to the shore of the milk ocean, where he offered prayers to please Lord Vishnu, who lay there on an island in transcendental ecstasy. Brahm&#257; thereafter understood the advice of Mah&#257;-Vishnu, who informed him that He would appear on the surface of the earth to mitigate the burden created by the demons. The demigods, along with their wives, should appear there as associates of Lord Krishna in the family of Yadu to increase the sons and grandsons in that dynasty. By the will of Lord Krishna, Anantadeva would appear first, as Balar&#257;ma, and Krishna's potency, yogam&#257;y&#257;, would also appear. Brahm&#257; informed mother earth about all this, and then he returned to his own abode.</P><P>After marrying Devak&#299;, Vasudeva was returning home with her on a chariot driven by Kamsa, her brother, when an ominous voice addressed Kamsa, warning him that Devak&#299;'s eighth son would kill him. Upon hearing this omen, Kamsa was immediately ready to kill Devak&#299;, but Vasudeva diplomatically began to instruct him. Vasudeva stressed that it would not be good for Kamsa to kill his younger sister, especially at the time of her marriage. Anyone who possesses a material body must die, Vasudeva advised him. Every living entity lives in a body for some time and then transmigrates to another body, but one is unfortunately misled into accepting the body as the soul. If a person under this mistaken conception wants to kill another body, he is condemned as hellish.</P><P>Because Kamsa was not satisfied by Vasudeva's instructions, Vasudeva devised a plan. He offered to bring Kamsa all of Devak&#299;'s children so that Kamsa could kill them. Why then should Kamsa kill Devak&#299; now? Kamsa was satisfied by this proposal. In due course of time, when Devak&#299; gave birth to a child, Vasudeva brought the newborn baby to Kamsa, who, upon seeing Vasudeva's magnanimity, was struck with wonder. When Vasudeva gave Kamsa the child, Kamsa, showing some intelligence, said that since he was to be killed by the eighth child, why should he kill the first? Although Vasudeva did not trust him, Kamsa requested Vasudeva to take the child back. Later, however, after N&#257;rada approached Kamsa and disclosed to him that the demigods were appearing in the Yadu and Vrishni dynasties and conspiring to kill him, Kamsa decided to kill all the children born in these families, and he also decided that any child born from the womb of Devak&#299; must be killed. Thus he arrested and imprisoned both Devak&#299; and Vasudeva and killed six of their sons, one after another. N&#257;rada had also informed Kamsa that in his previous birth Kamsa was K&#257;lanemi, a demon killed by Vishnu. Consequently, Kamsa became a great enemy to all the descendants of the yadu-vam&#347;a, the Yadu dynasty. He even arrested and imprisoned his own father, Ugrasena, for Kamsa wanted to enjoy the kingdom alone.</P><P>Krishna has threefold pastimes &#8212; the Vraja-l&#299;l&#257;, M&#257;thura-l&#299;l&#257; and Dv&#257;rak&#257;-l&#299;l&#257;. As already mentioned, in the Tenth Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam there are ninety chapters, which describe all these l&#299;l&#257;s. The first four chapters describe Brahm&#257;'s prayers for the relief of the earth's burden, and they also describe the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Chapters Five through Thirty-nine recount Krishna's pastimes in Vrind&#257;vana. The Fortieth Chapter describes how Krishna enjoyed in the water of the Yamun&#257; and how Akr&#363;ra offered prayers. Chapters Forty-one through Fifty-one, eleven chapters, tell of Krishna's pastimes in M&#257;thura, and Chapters Fifty-two through Ninety, thirty-nine chapters, relate Krishna's pastimes in Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</P><P>Chapters Twenty-nine through Thirty-three describe Krishna's dancing with the gop&#299;s, known as the r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;. Therefore these five chapters are known as r&#257;sa-pañc&#257;dhy&#257;ya. The Forty-seventh Chapter of the Tenth Canto is a description known as the bhramara-g&#299;t&#257;.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../../9/24/67.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
