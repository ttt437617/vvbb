By practicing mystic yoga, asuras generally attain some perfection in the eight siddhis, or perfections, namely anim&#257;, laghim&#257;, mahim&#257;, pr&#257;pti, pr&#257;k&#257;mya, &#299;&#347;itva, va&#347;itva and k&#257;m&#257;vas&#257;yit&#257;. But although a demon may acquire such powers to a very limited extent, he cannot compete with the mystic power of Krishna, for Krishna is Yoge&#347;vara, the source of all mystic power (yatra yoge&#347;varo harih). No one can compete with Krishna. Sometimes, of course, having acquired a fragmental portion of Krishna's mystic power, asuras demonstrate their power to the foolish public and assert themselves to be God, not knowing that God is the supreme Yoge&#347;vara. Here also we see that Trin&#257;varta assumed the mahim&#257;-siddhi and took Krishna away as if Krishna were an ordinary child. But Krishna also became a mystic mahim&#257;-siddha. When mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was carrying Him, He became so heavy that His mother, who was usually accustomed to carrying Him, could not bear Him and had to place Him down on the ground. Thus Trin&#257;varta had been able to take Krishna away in the presence of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. But when Krishna, high in the sky, assumed the mahim&#257;-siddhi, the demon, unable to go further, was obliged to stop his force and come down according to Krishna's desire. One should not, therefore, compete with Krishna's mystic power.</P><P>Devotees automatically have all mystic power, but they do not like to compete with Krishna. Instead, they fully surrender to Krishna, and their yogic power is demonstrated by Krishna's mercy. Devotees can show mystic yoga so powerful that a demon could not even dream of it, but they never try to demonstrate it for their personal sense gratification. Whatever they do is for the service of the Lord, and therefore they are always in a position superior to that of the demons. There are many karm&#299;s, yog&#299;s and jñ&#257;n&#299;s who artificially try to compete with Krishna, and thus ordinary, foolish people who do not care to hear &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam from authorities consider some rascal yog&#299; to be Bhagav&#257;n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the present moment there are many so-called b&#257;b&#257;s who present themselves as incarnations of God by showing some insignificant mystic wonder, and foolish people regard them as God because of lacking knowledge of Krishna.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
