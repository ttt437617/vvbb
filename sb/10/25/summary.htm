Similarly, these cowherd men have become intoxicated by pride and have offended me by taking shelter of an ignorant, ordinary child &#8212; Krishna."</P><P>To remove this supposed pride of the residents of Vraja, Indra sent the clouds known as S&#257;mvartaka, whose function is to facilitate the destruction of the world. He sent them to harass the Vrajav&#257;s&#299;s with downpours of rain and hail. The cowherd community was very disturbed by this and approached Krishna for shelter. Understanding that this trouble was the work of Indra, Krishna decided to smash to pieces Indra's false prestige, and thus He lifted Govardhana Hill with one hand. He then invited the entire cowherd community to take shelter in the dry space beneath the mountain. For seven successive days He held up the hill, until Indra finally understood Krishna's mystic power and ordered the clouds to withdraw.</P><P>When the cowherd villagers emerged from beneath the mountain, Krishna put Govardhana Hill back in its proper place. The cowherds were in ecstasy, showing loving symptoms such as flowing tears and bodily hairs standing on end. They embraced Krishna and offered Him benedictions according to their respective positions, while the demigods in heaven rained down flowers and sang the Lord's praises.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../24/38.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
