After glorifying his sons, Vasudeva fell at Lord Krishna's lotus feet and begged Him to drive away the conception that the Lord was his son. Instead, Lord Krishna restored that conception by instructing Vasudeva in the science of Godhead, and upon hearing these instructions, Vasudeva became peaceful and free of doubt.</P><P>Then mother Devak&#299; praised Krishna and Balar&#257;ma, reminding Them how They had retrieved the dead son of Their spiritual master. She said, "Please fulfill my desire in the same way. Please bring back my sons who were killed by Kamsa so I may see them once again." Entreated in this way by Their mother, the two Lords went to the subterranean planet of Sutala, where They approached Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. King Bali greeted Them respectfully, offering Them seats of honor, worshiping Them and reciting prayers. Krishna and Balar&#257;ma then requested Bali to return Devak&#299;'s dead sons. The Lords received the boys from Bali and returned them to Devak&#299; who felt such a surge of affection for them that milk began spontaneously flowing from her breasts. Overjoyed, Devak&#299; fed the children her breastmilk, and by drinking the remnants of milk once drunk by Lord Krishna Himself, they regained their original forms as demigods and went back to heaven.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../84/71.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
