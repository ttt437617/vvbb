In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/42.htm">10.42</A>) the Lord says:</P><P>athav&#257; bahunaitena</P><P CLASS=n>kim jñ&#257;tena tav&#257;rjuna</P><P CLASS=n>vishtabhy&#257;ham idam kritsnam</P><P CLASS=n>ek&#257;m&#347;ena sthito jagat</P><P>"But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe." Everything is situated as a part of the Supreme Lord's potency. In regard to Lord Krishna's appearance in the womb of Devak&#299;, Brahm&#257; played a part also because on the bank of the milk ocean he requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear. A part was also played by Baladeva, the first expansion of Godhead. Similarly, Yogam&#257;y&#257;, who appeared as the daughter of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, also played a part. Thus j&#299;va-tattva, vishnu-tattva and &#347;akti-tattva are all integrated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when Krishna appears, He appears with all His integrated parts. As explained in previous verses, Yogam&#257;y&#257; was requested to attract Sa&#324;karshana, Baladeva, from the womb of Devak&#299; to the womb of Rohin&#299;, and this was a very heavy task for her. Yogam&#257;y&#257; naturally could not see how it was possible for her to attract Sa&#324;karshana. Therefore Krishna addressed her as &#347;ubhe, auspicious, and said, "Be blessed. Take power from Me, and you will be able to do it." By the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, anyone can do anything, for the Lord is present in everything, all things being His parts and parcels (am&#347;a-bh&#257;gena) and increasing or decreasing by His supreme will. Balar&#257;ma was only fifteen days older than Krishna. By the blessings of Krishna, Yogam&#257;y&#257; became the daughter of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, but by the supreme will she was not able to enjoy the parental love of her father and mother. Krishna, however, although not actually born from the womb of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, enjoyed the parental love of mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Nanda. By the blessings of Krishna, Yogam&#257;y&#257; was able to achieve the reputation of being the daughter of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, who also became famous by the blessings of Krishna. Ya&#347;od&#257; means "one who gives fame."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
