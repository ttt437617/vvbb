Without difficulty, transfer Him into the womb of Rohin&#299;.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The first plenary expansion of Krishna is Baladeva, also known as &#346;esha. The &#346;esha incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead supports the entire universe, and the eternal mother of this incarnation is mother Rohin&#299;. "Because I am going into the womb of Devak&#299;," the Lord told Yogam&#257;y&#257;, "the &#346;esha incarnation has already gone there and made suitable arrangements so that I may live there. Now He should enter the womb of Rohin&#299;, His eternal mother."</P><P>In this connection, one may ask how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always situated transcendentally, could enter the womb of Devak&#299;, which had previously been entered by the six asuras, the shad-garbhas. Does this mean that the Shad-garbh&#257;suras were equal to the transcendental body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The following answer is given by &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura.</P><P>The entire creation, as well as its individual parts, is an expansion of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, even though the Lord enters the material world, He does not do so. This is explained by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/4.htm">9.4-5</A>):</P><P>may&#257; tatam idam sarvam</P><P CLASS=n>jagad avyakta-m&#363;rtin&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>mat-sth&#257;ni sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni</P><P CLASS=n>na c&#257;ham teshv avasthitah</P><P CLASS=n>na ca mat-sth&#257;ni bh&#363;t&#257;ni</P><P CLASS=n>pa&#347;ya me yogam ai&#347;varam</P><P CLASS=n>bh&#363;ta-bhrin na ca bh&#363;ta-stho</P><P CLASS=n>mam&#257;tm&#257; bh&#363;ta-bh&#257;vanah</P><P>"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them. And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities, and although I am everywhere, My Self is the very source of creation." Sarvam khalv idam brahma. Everything is an expansion of Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet everything is not the Supreme Godhead, and He is not everywhere. Everything rests upon Him and yet does not rest upon Him. This can be explained only through the acintya-bhed&#257;bheda philosophy. Such truths cannot be understood, however, unless one is a pure devotee, for the Lord says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/55.htm">18.55</A>), bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti y&#257;v&#257;n ya&#347; c&#257;smi tattvatah: "One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service." Even though the Lord cannot be understood by ordinary persons, this principle should be understood from the statement of the &#347;&#257;stras.</P><P>A pure devotee is always transcendentally situated because of executing nine different processes of bhakti-yoga (&#347;ravanam k&#299;rtanam vishnoh smaranam p&#257;da-sevanam/ arcanam vandanam d&#257;syam sakhyam &#257;tma-nivedanam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../7/5/23.htm">SB 7.5.23</A>]). Thus situated in devotional service, a devotee, although in the material world, is not in the material world. Yet a devotee always fears, "Because I am associated with the material world, so many contaminations affect me." Therefore he is always alert in fear, which gradually diminishes his material association.</P><P>Symbolically, mother Devak&#299;'s constant fear of Kamsa was purifying her. A pure devotee should always fear material association, and in this way all the asuras of material association will be killed, as the shad-garbh&#257;suras were killed by Kamsa. It is said that from the mind, Mar&#299;ci appears. In other words, Mar&#299;ci is an incarnation of the mind. Mar&#299;ci has six sons: K&#257;ma, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and M&#257;tsarya (lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness and envy). The Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in pure devotional service. This is confirmed in the Vedas: bhaktir evainam dar&#347;ayati. Only bhakti can bring one in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared from the womb of Devak&#299;, and therefore Devak&#299; symbolically represents bhakti, and Kamsa symbolically represents material fear. When a pure devotee always fears material association, his real position of bhakti is manifested, and he naturally becomes uninterested in material enjoyment. When the six sons of Mar&#299;ci are killed by such fear and one is freed from material contamination, within the womb of bhakti the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears. Thus the seventh pregnancy of Devak&#299; signifies the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After the six sons K&#257;ma, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and M&#257;tsarya are killed, the &#346;esha incarnation creates a suitable situation for the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, when one awakens his natural Krishna consciousness, Lord Krishna appears. This is the explanation given by &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
