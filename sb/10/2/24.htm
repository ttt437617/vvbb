In other words, by thinking of his all-pervading enemy, Kamsa became unfavorably Krishna conscious.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has described the finest pattern of devotional service as &#257;nuk&#363;lyena krishn&#257;nu&#347;&#299;lanam, or cultivating Krishna consciousness favorably. Kamsa, of course, was also Krishna conscious, but because he regarded Krishna as his enemy, even though he was fully absorbed in Krishna consciousness, his Krishna consciousness was not favorable for his existence. Krishna consciousness, favorably cultivated, makes one completely happy, so much so that a Krishna conscious person does not consider kaivalya-sukham, or merging into the existence of Krishna, to be a great gain. Kaivalyam narak&#257;yate. For a Krishna conscious person, even merging into the existence of Krishna, or Brahman, as impersonalists aspire to do, is uncomfortable. Kaivalyam narak&#257;yate trida&#347;a-p&#363;r &#257;k&#257;&#347;a-pushp&#257;yate. Karm&#299;s hanker to be promoted to the heavenly planets, but a Krishna conscious person considers such promotion a will-o'-the-wisp, good for nothing. Durd&#257;ntendriya-k&#257;la-sarpa-patal&#299; protkh&#257;ta-damshtr&#257;yate. Yog&#299;s try to control their senses and thus become happy, but a Krishna conscious person neglects the methods of yoga. He is unconcerned with the greatest of enemies, the senses, which are compared to snakes. For a Krishna conscious person who is cultivating Krishna consciousness favorably, the happiness conceived by the karm&#299;s, jñ&#257;n&#299;s and yog&#299;s is treated as less than a fig. Kamsa, however, because of cultivating Krishna consciousness in a different way &#8212; that is, inimically &#8212; was uncomfortable in all the affairs of his life; whether sitting, sleeping, walking or eating, he was always in danger. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. A nondevotee or atheist also cultivates God consciousness &#8212; by trying to avoid God in everything. For example, so-called scientists who want to create life by a combination of chemicals regard the external, material elements as supreme. Such scientists do not like the idea that life is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (mamaiv&#257;m&#347;o j&#299;va-loke j&#299;va-bh&#363;tah), the living entities do not arise from a combination of material elements, such as earth, water, air and fire, but are separated portions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one can understand the position of the living entity as a separated portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by studying the nature of the living entity one can understand the nature of the Supreme Godhead, since the living entity is a fragmental sample of the Godhead. But because atheists are not interested in God consciousness, they try to be happy by cultivating Krishna consciousness in various unfavorable ways.</P><P>Although Kamsa was always absorbed in thoughts of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was not happy. A devotee, however, whether sitting on a throne or beneath a tree, is always happy. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; resigned from office as a government minister to sit beneath a tree, yet he was happy. Tyaktv&#257; t&#363;rnam a&#347;esha-mandalapati-&#347;ren&#299;m sad&#257; tucchavat (Shad-gosv&#257;my-ashtaka 4). He did not care for his comfortable position as minister; he was happy even beneath a tree in Vrind&#257;vana, favorably serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. For a nondevotee, the world is full of problems, whereas for a devotee the entire world is full of happiness.</P><P>vi&#347;vam p&#363;rna-sukh&#257;yate vidhi-mahendr&#257;di&#347; ca k&#299;t&#257;yate</P><P CLASS=n>yat-k&#257;runya-kat&#257;ksha-vaibhavavat&#257;m tam gauram eva stumah</P><P CLASS=n>(Caitanya-candr&#257;mrita 95)</P><P>This comfortable position of a devotee can be established by the mercy of Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu.
