Thus one can perceive You in many different forms by hearing from authorities and by direct experience.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The grammatical agreement of &#347;ruta-pratyaksha-gocaram, in the neuter case, with &#257;tma-srishtam idam vi&#347;vam indicates that the Supreme Lord, by entering His creation with His potencies, makes Himself perceivable within the universe. Throughout the Bh&#257;gavatam and other authorized Vedic literatures, we often find descriptions of the Lord's simultaneous supremacy over all other things and His identity with them. We cannot reasonably draw any other conclusion from Vedic literature than the one powerfully preached by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu: acintya-bhed&#257;bheda-tattva. That is, the Absolute Truth is greater than and distinct from everything (since He is the omnipotent creator and controller of all), and simultaneously one with everything (since all that exists is the expansion of His own power).</P><P>Throughout these chapters of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, we also observe one of the unique, extraordinary features of this great work. Whether Krishna is sending His message to the gop&#299;s or accepting the prayers of Akr&#363;ra, there is constant philosophical discussion. Throughout the Bh&#257;gavatam, the steady combination of fascinating pastimes with persistent spiritual philosophy is an extraordinary feature. We are allowed to glimpse and even to relish the spiritual emotions of the Lord and His liberated associates, and yet we are constantly reminded of their ontological position lest we lapse into a cheap, anthropomorphic vision. Thus it is entirely in character with the work that Akr&#363;ra, in his ecstasy, glorifies the Lord with precise philosophical prayers.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
