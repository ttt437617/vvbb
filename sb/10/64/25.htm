It is also clear that King Nriga considered such piety to be a separate goal, desirable for its own sake. Thus he did not fully appreciate pure devotional service to Lord Krishna. Krishna had not been the only goal of Nriga's life, as He was for Ambar&#299;sha Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, even in the stage of regulative practice. Nor do we find that King Nriga overcame obstacles like those Ambar&#299;sha did when Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni became angry at him. Still, we can conclude that since Nriga was able to see the Lord for some reason or another, he must have had the good quality of sincerely desiring the Lord's association."</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da confirms the above analysis in Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: "On the whole, [Nriga] had not developed Krishna consciousness. The Krishna conscious person develops love of God, Krishna, not love for pious or impious activities; therefore he is not subjected to the results of such action. As stated in the Brahma-samhit&#257;, a devotee, by the grace of the Lord, does not become subjected to the resultant reactions of fruitive activities."</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; offers the following commentary: "When Nriga mentioned 'one who hankered to have Your audience,' he was referring to an incident concerning a certain great devotee King Nriga had once met. This devotee was very eager to acquire a temple for a most beautiful Deity of the Supreme Lord, and he also wanted copies of such scriptures as the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; and &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam. Being very generous, Nriga arranged for these things, and the devotee was so satisfied that he blessed the King: 'My dear King, may you have the audience of the Supreme Lord.' From that time on, Nriga desired to see the Lord."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
