Inside a dry well they found an amazing creature: a huge lizard resembling a hill. The boys felt sorry for it and tried to pull it out. But after several attempts with leather thongs and ropes, they saw that they would not be able to rescue the creature, and thus they went to Lord Krishna and told Him what had happened. The Lord accompanied them to the well and, extending His left hand, easily lifted the lizard out. By the touch of Lord Krishna's hand the creature transformed at once into a demigod. Then Lord Krishna asked, "Who are you, and how did you assume such a lowly form?</P><P>The divine being replied, "My name was King Nriga, son of Ikshv&#257;ku, and I was famous for giving charity. Indeed, I gave away countless cows to numerous br&#257;hmanas. But on one occasion a cow belonging to a first-class br&#257;hmana wandered into my herd. Unaware of this, I gave this cow in charity to a different br&#257;hmana. When the cow's previous owner saw the second br&#257;hmana taking this cow away, the first br&#257;hmana claimed the cow as his and began arguing with the second br&#257;hmana. After quarreling for some time they approached me, and I implored them to each take one hundred thousand cows in exchange for that one cow, and to please forgive me for the offense I had unknowingly committed. But neither br&#257;hmana would accept my proposal, and the matter remained unsettled.</P><P>"Shortly thereafter I died and was taken by the Yamad&#363;tas to the court of Yamar&#257;ja. Yama asked me which I preferred to do first: suffer the results of my sins or enjoy the results of my pious acts. I decided to suffer my sinful reactions first, and thus I assumed the body of a lizard."</P><P>After King Nriga had told his story, he offered prayers to Lord Krishna and then mounted a celestial airplane, which transported him to heaven.</P><P>Lord Krishna then instructed His personal associates, as well as the general mass of people, on the dangers of stealing a br&#257;hmana 's property. Finally, the Lord returned to His palace.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../63/53.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
