He received the Yadus, Vrishnis, Andhakas, Madhus, D&#257;&#347;&#257;rhas, Kukuras and other clans with due honor, and He also consoled them, for they were weary of living in foreign lands. Then Lord Krishna, the creator of the universe, resettled them in their homes and gratified them with valuable gifts.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17-18.htm"><B>SB 10.45.17-18</B></A>: The members of these clans, protected by the arms of Lord Krishna and Lord Sa&#324;karshana, felt that all their desires were fulfilled. Thus they enjoyed perfect happiness while living at home with their families. Because of the presence of Krishna and Balar&#257;ma, they no longer suffered from the fever of material existence. Every day these loving devotees could see Mukunda's ever-cheerful lotus face, which was decorated with beautiful, merciful smiling glances.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 10.45.19</B></A>: Even the most elderly inhabitants of the city appeared youthful, full of strength and vitality, for with their eyes they constantly drank the elixir of Lord Mukunda's lotus face.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 10.45.20</B></A>: Then, O exalted Par&#299;kshit, the Supreme Lord Krishna, the son of Devak&#299;, along with Lord Balar&#257;ma, approached Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja.

All these cows wore gold necklaces and linen wreaths.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 10.45.28</B></A>: The magnanimous Vasudeva then remembered the cows he had mentally given away on the occasion of Krishna's and Balar&#257;ma's birth.

Thus They approached S&#257;nd&#299;pani Muni, a native of K&#257;s&#299; living in the city of Avant&#299;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>SB 10.45.32</B></A>: S&#257;nd&#299;pani thought very highly of these two self-controlled disciples, whom he had obtained so fortuitously. By serving him as devotedly as one would serve the Supreme Lord Himself, They showed others an irreproachable example of how to worship the spiritual master.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>SB 10.45.33</B></A>: That best of br&#257;hmanas, the spiritual master S&#257;nd&#299;pani, was satisfied with Their submissive behavior, and thus he taught Them the entire Vedas, together with their six corollaries and the Upanishads.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>SB 10.45.34</B></A>: He also taught Them the Dhanur-veda, with its most confidential secrets; the standard books of law; the methods of logical reasoning and philosophical debate; and the sixfold science of politics.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35-36.htm"><B>SB 10.45.35-36</B></A>: O King, those best of persons, Krishna and Balar&#257;ma, being Themselves the original promulgators of all varieties of knowledge, could immediately assimilate each and every subject after hearing it explained just once. Thus with fixed concentration They learned the sixty-four arts and skills in as many days and nights. Thereafter, O King, They satisfied Their spiritual master by offering him guru-dakshin&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>SB 10.45.37</B></A>: O King, the learned br&#257;hmana S&#257;nd&#299;pani carefully considered the two Lords' glorious and amazing qualities and Their superhuman intelligence.

When They reached that place, They walked up to the shore and sat down. In a moment the deity of the ocean, recognizing Them to be the Supreme Lords, approached Them with offerings of tribute.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm"><B>SB 10.45.39</B></A>: The Supreme Lord Krishna addressed the lord of the ocean: Let the son of My guru be presented at once &#8212; the one you seized here with your mighty waves.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm"><B>SB 10.45.40</B></A>: The ocean replied: O Lord Krishna, it was not I who abducted him, but a demonic descendant of Diti named Pañcajana, who travels in the water in the form of a conch.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm"><B>SB 10.45.41</B></A>: "Indeed," the ocean said, "that demon has taken him away." Hearing this, Lord Krishna entered the ocean, found Pañcajana and killed him. But the Lord did not find the boy within the demon's belly.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42-44.htm"><B>SB 10.45.42-44</B></A>: Lord Jan&#257;rdana took the conchshell that had grown around the demon's body and went back to the chariot. Then He proceeded to Samyaman&#299;, the beloved capital of Yamar&#257;ja, the lord of death. Upon arriving there with Lord Balar&#257;ma, He loudly blew His conchshell, and Yamar&#257;ja, who keeps the conditioned souls in check, came as soon as he heard the resounding vibration. Yamar&#257;ja elaborately worshiped the two Lords with great devotion, and then he addressed Lord Krishna, who lives in everyone's heart: "O Supreme Lord Vishnu, what shall I do for You and Lord Balar&#257;ma, who are playing the part of ordinary humans?"</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm"><B>SB 10.45.45</B></A>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Suffering the bondage of his past activity, My spiritual master's son was brought here to you.

Indeed, with disciples like You, what further desires could a guru have?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm"><B>SB 10.45.48</B></A>: O heroes, now please return home. May Your fame sanctify the world, and may the Vedic hymns be ever fresh in Your minds, both in this life and the next.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm"><B>SB 10.45.49</B></A>: Thus receiving Their guru's permission to leave, the two Lords returned to Their city on Their chariot, which moved as swiftly as the wind and resounded like a cloud.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm"><B>SB 10.45.50</B></A>: All the citizens rejoiced upon seeing Krishna and Balar&#257;ma, whom they had not seen for many days.
