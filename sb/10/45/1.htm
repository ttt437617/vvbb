Lord Krishna did not want this. Rather, the Lord wanted to enjoy with them the ecstatic love of v&#257;tsalya-rasa, the relationship between parents and children. As &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da often pointed out, although we normally think of God as the supreme father, in Krishna consciousness we can enter into the Lord's pastimes and play the part of His parents, thus intensifying our love for Him.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura points out that the word jana may be translated here as "devotees," as in the verse d&#299;yam&#257;nam na grihnanti vin&#257; mat-sevanam janah (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/3/29/13.htm">3.29.13</A>). He further explains that jana may also be translated as "parents," since jana is derived from the verb jan, which in the causative form (janayate) means "to generate or to give birth to." In this sense of the word (as in janan&#299; or janakau), the term jana-mohin&#299; indicates that the Lord was about to expand His internal illusory potency so that Vasudeva and Devak&#299; would again love Him as their dear child.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="summary.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
