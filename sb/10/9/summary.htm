The maidservants being engaged in other business, she stopped allowing Krishna to drink from her breast and immediately attended to the overflowing milk pan. Krishna became very angry because of His mother's behavior and devised a means of breaking the pots of yogurt. Because He created this disturbance, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; decided to bind Him. These incidents are described in this chapter.</P><P>One day, the maidservants being engaged in other work, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was churning the yogurt into butter herself, and in the meantime Krishna came and requested her to allow Him to suck her breast milk. Of course, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; immediately allowed Him to do so, but then she saw that the hot milk on the oven was boiling over, and therefore she immediately stopped allowing Krishna to drink the milk of her breast and went to stop the milk on the oven from overflowing. Krishna, however, having been interrupted in His business of sucking the breast, was very angry. He took a piece of stone, broke the churning pot and entered a room, where He began to eat the freshly churned butter. When mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, after attending to the overflowing milk, returned and saw the pot broken, she could understand that this was the work of Krishna, and therefore she went to search for Him. When she entered the room, she saw Krishna standing on the ul&#363;khala, a large mortar for grinding spices. Having turned the mortar upside down, He was stealing butter hanging from a swing and was distributing the butter to the monkeys. As soon as Krishna saw that His mother had come, He immediately began to run away, and mother Ya&#347;od&#257; began to follow Him. After going some distance, mother Ya&#347;od&#257; was able to catch Krishna, who because of His offense was crying. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, of course, threatened to punish Krishna if He acted that way again, and she decided to bind Him with rope. Unfortunately, when the time came to knot the rope, the rope with which she wanted to bind Him was short by a distance equal to the width of two fingers. When she made the rope longer by adding another rope, she again saw that it was short by two fingers. Again and again she tried, and again and again she found the rope too short by two fingers. Thus she became very tired, and Krishna, seeing His affectionate mother so tired, allowed Himself to be bound. Now, being compassionate, He did not show her His unlimited potency. After mother Ya&#347;od&#257; bound Krishna and became engaged in other household affairs, Krishna observed two yamala-arjuna trees, which were actually Nalak&#363;vara and Manigr&#299;va, two sons of Kuvera who had been condemned by N&#257;rada Muni to become trees. Krishna, by His mercy, now began to proceed toward the trees to fulfill the desire of N&#257;rada Muni.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../8/52.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1-2.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
