He tried to understand who was real and who was not real, but he couldn't understand at all.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Brahm&#257; was puzzled. "The original boys and calves are still sleeping as I have kept them," he thought, "but another set is here playing with Krishna. How has this happened?" Brahm&#257; could not grasp what was happening. Which boys were real, and which were not real? Brahm&#257; was unable to come to any definite conclusion. He pondered the matter for a long while. "How can there be two sets of calves and boys at the same time? Have the boys and calves here been created by Krishna, or has Krishna created the ones lying asleep? Or are both merely creations of Krishna?" Brahm&#257; thought about the subject in many different ways. "After I go to the cave and see that the boys and calves are still there, does Krishna go take them away and put them here so that I come here and see them, and does Krishna then take them from here and put them there?" Brahm&#257; could not figure out how there could be two sets of calves and cowherd boys exactly alike. Although thinking and thinking, he could not understand at all.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
