Actually Krishna is everything, but at that time, expressing extreme love and affection, they took special pleasure in feeding Krishna, the Parabrahman, and Krishna drank the milk from His respective mothers as if it were a nectarean beverage.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Although all the elderly gop&#299;s knew that Krishna was the son of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, they still desired, "If Krishna had become my son, I would also have taken care of Him like mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. "This was their inner ambition. Now, in order to please them, Krishna personally took the role of their sons and fulfilled their desire. They enhanced their special love for Krishna by embracing Him and feeding Him, and Krishna tasted their breast milk to be just like a nectarean beverage. While thus bewildering Brahm&#257;, He enjoyed the special transcendental pleasure created by yogam&#257;y&#257; between all the other mothers and Himself.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
