What happened was this. After killing Agh&#257;sura, Krishna, along with His associates the cowherd boys, went for a picnic within the forest. The calves, being allured by green grasses, gradually went far away, and therefore Krishna's associates became a little agitated and wanted to bring back the calves. Krishna, however, encouraged the boys by saying, "You take your tiffin without being agitated. I shall go find the calves." And thus the Lord departed. Then, just to examine the potency of Krishna, Lord Brahm&#257; took away all the calves and cowherd boys and kept them in a secluded place.</P><P>When Krishna was unable to find the calves and boys, He could understand that this was a trick performed by Brahm&#257;. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, in order to please Lord Brahm&#257;, as well as His own associates and their mothers, expanded Himself to become the calves and boys, exactly as they were before. In this way, He discovered another pastime. A special feature of this pastime was that the mothers of the cowherd boys thus became more attached to their respective sons, and the cows became more attached to their calves. After nearly a year, Baladeva observed that all the cowherd boys and calves were expansions of Krishna. Thus He inquired from Krishna and was informed of what had happened.</P><P>When one full year had passed, Brahm&#257; returned and saw that Krishna was still engaged as usual with His friends and the calves and cows. Then Krishna exhibited all the calves and cowherd boys as four-armed forms of N&#257;r&#257;yana. Brahm&#257; could then understand Krishna's potency, and he was astonished by the pastimes of Krishna, his worshipable Lord. Krishna, however, bestowed His causeless mercy upon Brahm&#257; and released him from illusion. Thus Brahm&#257; began to offer prayers to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../12/44.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
