If we develop consciousness of this fact, then we are in actual Krishna consciousness. We should always remember that Krishna is the only supreme master and that everyone else is His servant (ekale &#299;&#347;vara krishna, &#257;ra saba bhritya). Be one even N&#257;r&#257;yana or Lord &#346;iva, everyone is subordinate to Krishna (&#347;iva-viriñcinutam). Even Baladeva is subordinate to Krishna.

No one can compare to N&#257;r&#257;yana, or Krishna. Krishna is N&#257;r&#257;yana, and N&#257;r&#257;yana is also Krishna, for Krishna is the original N&#257;r&#257;yana. Brahm&#257; himself addressed Krishna, n&#257;r&#257;yanas tvam na hi sarva-dehin&#257;m: "You are also N&#257;r&#257;yana. Indeed, You are the original N&#257;r&#257;yana." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/10/14/14.htm">10.14.14</A>)</P><P>K&#257;la, or the time factor, has many assistants, such as svabh&#257;va, samsk&#257;ra, k&#257;ma, karma and guna. Svabh&#257;va, or one's own nature, is formed according to the association of the material qualities. K&#257;ranam guna-sa&#324;go 'sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/13/22.htm">Bg. 13.22</A>). Sat and asat-svabh&#257;va &#8212; one's higher or lower nature &#8212; is formed by association with the different qualities, namely sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. We should gradually come to the sattva-guna, so that we may avoid the two lower gunas. This can be done if we regularly discuss &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam and hear about Krishna's activities. Nashta-pr&#257;yeshv abhadreshu nityam bh&#257;gavata-sevay&#257; (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/2/18.htm">1.2.18</A>). All the activities of Krishna described in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, beginning even with the pastimes concerning P&#363;tan&#257;, are transcendental. Therefore, by hearing and discussing &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, the rajo-guna and tamo-guna are subdued, so that only sattva-guna remains. Then rajo-guna and tamo-guna cannot do us any harm.</P><P>Varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma, therefore, is essential, for it can bring people to sattva-guna. Tad&#257; rajas-tamo-bh&#257;v&#257;h k&#257;ma-lobh&#257;daya&#347; ca ye (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/2/19.htm">1.2.19</A>). Tamo-guna and rajo-guna increase lust and greed, which implicate a living entity in such a way that he must exist in this material world in many, many forms. That is very dangerous. One should therefore be brought to sattva-guna by the establishment of varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma and should develop the brahminical qualifications of being very neat and clean, rising early in the morning and seeing ma&#324;gala-&#257;r&#257;trika, and so on. In this way, one should stay in sattva-guna, and then one cannot be influenced by tamo-guna and rajo-guna.</P><P>tad&#257; rajas-tamo-bh&#257;v&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>k&#257;ma-lobh&#257;daya&#347; ca ye</P><P CLASS=n>ceta etair an&#257;viddham</P><P CLASS=n>sthitam sattve pras&#299;dati</P><P>(Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/2/19.htm">1.2.19</A>)</P><P>The opportunity for this purification is the special feature of human life; in other lives, this is not possible. Such purification can be achieved very easily by r&#257;dh&#257;-krishna-bhajana, devotional service rendered to R&#257;dh&#257; and Krishna, and therefore Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura sings, hari hari viphale janama go&#324;&#257;inu, indicating that unless one worships R&#257;dh&#257;-Krishna, one's human form of life is wasted. V&#257;sudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogah prayojitah/ janayaty &#257;&#347;u vair&#257;gyam (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/2/7.htm">1.2.7</A>). By engagement in the service of V&#257;sudeva, one very quickly renounces material life. The members of the Krishna consciousness movement, for example, being engaged in v&#257;sudeva-bhakti, very quickly come to the stage of being nice Vaishnavas, so much so that people are surprised that mlecchas and yavanas are able to come to this stage. This is possible by v&#257;sudeva-bhakti. But if we do not come to the stage of sattva-guna in this human life, then, as Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura sings, hari hari viphale janama go&#324;&#257;inu &#8212; there is no profit in gaining this human form of life.</P><P>&#346;r&#299; V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya comments that each of the items mentioned in the first half of this verse is a cause for material entanglement. K&#257;la, or the time factor, agitates the modes of material nature, and svabh&#257;va is the result of association with these modes. Therefore Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura says, bhakta-sane v&#257;sa. If one associates with bhaktas, then one's svabh&#257;va, or nature, will change. Our Krishna consciousness movement is meant to give people good association so that this change may take place, and we actually see that by this method people all over the world are gradually becoming devotees.</P><P>As for samsk&#257;ra, or reformation, this is possible by good association, for by good association one develops good habits, and habit becomes second nature. Therefore, bhakta-sane v&#257;sa: let people have the chance to live with bhaktas. Then their habits will change. In the human form of life one has this chance, but as Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura sings, hari hari viphale janama go&#324;&#257;inu: if one fails to take advantage of this opportunity, one's human life is wasted. We are therefore trying to save human society from degradation and actually elevate people to the higher nature.</P><P>As for k&#257;ma and karma &#8212; desires and activities &#8212; if one engages in devotional service, one develops a different nature than if one engages in activities of sense gratification, and of course the result is also different. According to the association of different natures, one receives a particular type of body. K&#257;ranam guna-sa&#324;go 'sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/13/22.htm">Bg. 13.22</A>). Therefore we should always seek good association, the association of devotees. Then our life will be successful. A man is known by his company. If one has the chance to live in the good association of devotees, one is able to cultivate knowledge, and naturally one's character or nature will change for one's eternal benefit.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="54.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
