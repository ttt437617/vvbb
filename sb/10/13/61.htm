The Lord's knowledge is unlimited, and therefore one cannot touch where it ends, just as one cannot measure the ocean. What is the extent of our intelligence in comparison to the vast expanse of water in the ocean? On my passage to America, how insignificant the ship was, like a matchbox in the midst of the ocean. Krishna's intelligence resembles the ocean, for one cannot imagine how vast it is. The best course, therefore, is to surrender to Krishna. Don't try to measure Krishna.</P><P>The word advayam, meaning "one without a second," is also significant. Because Brahm&#257; was overcast by Krishna's m&#257;y&#257;, he was thinking himself the Supreme. In the material world, everyone thinks, "I am the best man in this world. I know everything." One thinks, "Why should I read Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;? I know everything. I have my own interpretation." Brahm&#257;, however, was able to understand that the Supreme Personality is Krishna. &#298;&#347;varah paramah krishnah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>]. Another of Krishna's names, therefore, is parame&#347;vara.</P><P>Now Brahm&#257; saw Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing as a cowherd boy in Vrind&#257;vana, not demonstrating His opulence but standing just like an innocent boy with some food in His hand, loitering with His cowherd boyfriends, calves and cows. Brahm&#257; did not see Krishna as catur-bhuja, the opulent N&#257;r&#257;yana; rather, he simply saw an innocent boy. Nonetheless, he could understand that although Krishna was not demonstrating His power, He was the same Supreme person. people generally do not appreciate someone unless he shows something wonderful, but here, although Krishna did not manifest anything wonderful, Brahm&#257; could understand that the same wonderful person was present like an ordinary child, although He was the master of the whole creation. Thus Brahm&#257; prayed, govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi **: "You are the original person, the cause of everything. I bow down to You." This was his realization. Tam aham bhaj&#257;mi. This is what is wanted. Vedeshu durlabham: one cannot reach Krishna merely by Vedic knowledge. Adurlabham &#257;tma-bhaktau: but when one becomes a devotee, then one can realize Him. Brahm&#257;, therefore, became a devotee. In the beginning he was proud of being Brahm&#257;, the lord of the universe, but now he understood, "Here is the Lord of the universe. I am simply an insignificant agent. Govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi **."</P><P>Krishna was playing like a dramatic actor. Because Brahm&#257; had some false prestige, thinking that he had some power, Krishna showed him his real position. A similar incident occurred when Brahm&#257; went to see Krishna in Dv&#257;rak&#257;. When Krishna's doorman informed Lord Krishna that Lord Brahm&#257; had arrived, Krishna responded, "Which Brahm&#257;? Ask him which Brahm&#257;." The doorman relayed this question, and Brahm&#257; was astonished. "Is there another Brahm&#257; besides me?" he thought. When the doorman informed Lord Krishna, "It is four-headed Brahm&#257;," Lord Krishna said, "Oh, four-headed. Call others. Show him." This is Krishna's position. For Krishna the four-headed Brahm&#257; is insignificant, to say nothing of "four-headed scientists." Materialistic scientists think that although this planet earth is full of opulence, all others are vacant. Because they simply speculate, this is their scientific conclusion. But from the Bh&#257;gavatam we understand that the entire universe is full of living entities everywhere. Thus it is the folly of the scientists that although they do not know anything, they mislead people by presenting themselves as scientists, philosophers and men of knowledge.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="60.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="62.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
