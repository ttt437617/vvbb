Therefore the mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata, the topmost devotee, sees everyone as being engaged in the service of Krishna; only himself does he see as not engaged. We have to elevate ourselves from a lower position to a higher position, and the topmost position is that of direct service in Vrind&#257;vana. But everyone is engaged in service. Denial of the service of the Lord is m&#257;y&#257;.</P><P>ekale &#299;&#347;vara krishna, &#257;ra saba bhritya</P><P CLASS=n>y&#257;re yaiche n&#257;c&#257;ya, se taiche kare nritya</P><P>"Only Krishna is the supreme master, and all others are His servants. As Krishna desires, everyone dances according to His tune.' (Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/adi/5/142.htm">&#256;di 5.142</A>)</P><P>There are two kinds of living entities &#8212; the moving and the nonmoving. Trees, for example, stand in one place, whereas ants move. Brahm&#257; saw that all of them, down to the smallest creatures, had assumed different forms and were accordingly engaged in the service of Lord Vishnu.</P><P>One receives a form according to the way one worships the Lord. In the material world, the body one receives is guided by the demigods. This is sometimes referred to as the influence of the stars. As indicated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/3/27.htm">3.27</A>) by the words prakriteh kriyam&#257;n&#257;ni, according to the laws of nature one is controlled by the demigods.</P><P>All living entities are serving Krishna in different ways, but when they are Krishna conscious, their service is fully manifest. As a flower in the bud gradually fructifies and yields its desired aroma and beauty, so when a living entity comes to the platform of Krishna consciousness, the beauty of his real form comes into full blossom. That is the ultimate beauty and the ultimate fulfillment of desire.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
