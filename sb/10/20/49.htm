The mercantile community, the royal order and the great sages were free to move to achieve their desired benedictions. Similarly, the transcendentalists, when freed from the encagement of the material body, also achieved their desired goal. During the rainy season, the mercantile community cannot move from one place to another and so do not get their desired profit. Nor can the royal order go from one place to another to collect taxes from the people. As for saintly persons who must travel to preach transcendental knowledge, they also are restrained by the rainy season. But during the autumn, all of them leave their confines. In the case of the transcendentalist, be he a jñ&#257;n&#299;, a yog&#299; or a devotee, because of the material body he cannot actually enjoy spiritual achievement. But as soon as he gives up the body, or after death, the jñ&#257;n&#299; merges into the spiritual effulgence of the Supreme Lord, the yog&#299; transfers himself to the various higher planets, and the devotee goes to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vrind&#257;vana, or the Vaikunthas, and thus enjoys his eternal spiritual life."</P><P>Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A .
