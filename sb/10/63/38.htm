The Lord is eka advit&#299;yah, "one without a second," because there is no one equal to the Lord or different from Him. No one is completely equal to the Supreme Godhead, and yet because all the living beings are expansions of the potency of the Godhead, no one is qualitatively different from Him. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu nicely explains this inconceivable situation by stating that the Absolute Truth and the living beings are qualitatively one but quantitatively different. The Absolute possesses infinite spiritual consciousness, whereas the living beings possess infinitesimal consciousness, which is subject to being covered by illusion.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, commenting on the term &#257;dyah purushah, quotes from the S&#257;tvata-tantra: vishnos tu tr&#299;ni r&#363;p&#257;ni. "There are three forms of Vishnu [for cosmic manifestation, etc.]." &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; also quotes a statement of the Lord's from &#347;ruti: p&#363;rvam ev&#257;ham ih&#257;sam. "In the beginning I alone existed in this world." This statement describes the form of the Lord called the purusha-avat&#257;ra, who exists before the cosmic manifestation. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; also quotes the following &#347;ruti-mantra: tat-purushasya purushatvam, which means "Such constitutes the Lord's status as purusha." Actually, Lord Krishna is the essence of the purusha incarnation because He is tur&#299;ya, as described in the present verse. J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; explains the term tur&#299;ya (literally "the fourth") by quoting &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;'s commentary to the Bh&#257;gavatam verse <A CLASS=v HREF="../../11/15/16.htm">11.15.16</A>:</P><P>vir&#257;t hiranyagarbha&#347; ca</P><P CLASS=n>k&#257;ranam cety up&#257;dhayah</P><P CLASS=n>&#299;&#347;asya yat tribhir h&#299;nam</P><P CLASS=n>tur&#299;yam tad vidur budh&#257;h</P><P>"The Lord's universal form, His Hiranyagarbha form and the primeval causal manifestation of material nature are all relative conceptions, but because the Lord Himself is not covered by these three, intelligent authorities call Him 'the fourth.' "</P><P>According to &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, the word tur&#299;ya indicates that the Lord is the fourth member of the quadruple expansion of Godhead called the Catur-vy&#363;ha. In other words, Lord Krishna is V&#257;sudeva.</P><P>Lord Krishna is sva-drik &#8212; that is, He alone can perceive Himself perfectly &#8212; because He is infinite spiritual existence, infinitely pure. He is hetu, the cause of everything, and yet He is ahetu, without cause. Therefore He is &#299;&#347;a, the supreme controller.</P><P>The last two lines of this verse are of special philosophical significance. Why is the Lord perceived differently by different persons, although He is one? A partial explanation is given here. By the agency of M&#257;y&#257;, the Lord's external potency, material nature is in a constant state of transformation, vik&#257;ra. In one sense, then, material nature is "unreal," asat. But because God is the supreme reality, and because He is present within all things and all things are His potency, material objects and energies possess a degree of reality. Therefore some people see one aspect of material energy and think, "This is reality," while other people see a different aspect of material energy and think, "No, that is reality." Being conditioned souls, we are covered by different configurations of material nature, and thus we describe the Supreme Truth or the Supreme Lord in terms of our corrupted vision. Yet even the covering qualities of material nature, such as our conditioned intelligence, mind and senses, are real (being the potency of the Supreme Lord), and therefore through all things we can perceive, in a more or less subjective way, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is why the present verse states, prat&#299;yase: "You are perceived." Furthermore, without the manifestation of material nature's covering qualities, the creation could not fulfill its purpose &#8212; namely, to allow the conditioned souls to make their best attempt to enjoy without God so that they will finally understand the futility of such an illusory notion.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
