When they finally heard from N&#257;rada Muni how Aniruddha had been captured, a large army of the best Y&#257;dava warriors, under Krishna's protection, set off for B&#257;n&#257;sura's capital and laid siege to it. B&#257;n&#257;sura fiercely opposed them with his own army of equal size. To help B&#257;n&#257;sura, Lord &#346;iva, accompanied by K&#257;rtikeya and a horde of mystic sages, took up arms against Balar&#257;ma and Krishna. B&#257;na began fighting against S&#257;tyaki, and B&#257;na's son fought against S&#257;mba. All the demigods assembled in the sky to witness the battle. With His arrows Lord Krishna harassed the followers of Lord &#346;iva, and by putting Lord &#346;iva into a state of confusion He was able to destroy B&#257;n&#257;sura's army. K&#257;rtikeya was so strongly beaten by Pradyumna that he fled the battlefield, while the remnants of B&#257;n&#257;sura's army, harried by the blows of Lord Balar&#257;ma's club, scattered in all directions.</P><P>Enraged to see his army's destruction, B&#257;n&#257;sura rushed Krishna to attack Him. But the Lord immediately killed B&#257;na's chariot driver and broke his chariot and bow, and then He sounded His P&#257;ñcajanya conchshell. Next B&#257;n&#257;sura's mother, trying to save her son, appeared naked in front of Lord Krishna, who averted His face to avoid looking at her. Seeing his chance, B&#257;na fled into his city.</P><P>After Lord Krishna had thoroughly defeated the ghosts and hobgoblins fighting under Lord &#346;iva, the &#346;iva-jvara weapon &#8212; a personification of fever with three heads and three legs &#8212; approached Lord Krishna to fight Him. Seeing the &#346;iva-jvara, Krishna released His Vishnu-jvara. The &#346;iva-jvara was overwhelmed by the Vishnu-jvara; having nowhere else to turn for shelter, the &#346;iva-jvara began to address Lord Krishna, glorifying Him and asking for mercy. Lord Krishna was pleased with the &#346;iva-jvara, and after the Lord had promised him freedom from fear, the &#346;iva-jvara bowed down to Him and departed.</P><P>Next B&#257;n&#257;sura returned and attacked Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna again, wielding all kinds of weapons in his thousand hands. But Lord Krishna took His Sudar&#347;ana disc and began cutting off all the demon's arms Lord &#346;iva approached Krishna to pray for B&#257;n&#257;sura's life, and when the Lord agreed to spare him, He spoke as follows to &#346;iva: "B&#257;n&#257;sura does not deserve to die, since he was born in the family of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. I have severed all but four of B&#257;na's arms just to destroy his false pride, and I have annihilated his army because they were a burden to the earth. Henceforward he will be free from old age and death, and remaining fearless in all circumstances, he will be one of your principal attendants."</P><P>Assured he had nothing to fear, B&#257;n&#257;sura then offered his obeisances to Lord Krishna and had &#362;sh&#257; and Aniruddha seated on their wedding chariot and brought before the Lord. Krishna then set off for Dv&#257;rak&#257; with Aniruddha and His bride leading the procession. When the newlyweds arrived at the Lord's capital, they were honored by the citizens, the Lord's relatives and the br&#257;hmanas.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../62/33.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
