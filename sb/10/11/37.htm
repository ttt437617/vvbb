In due course of time, They became old enough to take care of the calves.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>As soon as Krishna and Balar&#257;ma were a little grown up, They were meant for taking care of the calves. Although born of a very well-to-do family, They still had to take care of the calves. This was the system of education. Those who were not born in br&#257;hmana families were not meant for academic education. The br&#257;hmanas were trained in a literary, academic education, the kshatriyas were trained to take care of the state, and the vai&#347;yas learned how to cultivate the land and take care of the cows and calves. There was no need to waste time going to school to be falsely educated and later increase the numbers of the unemployed. Krishna and Balar&#257;ma taught us by Their personal behavior. Krishna took care of the cows and played His flute, and Balar&#257;ma took care of agricultural activities with a plow in His hand.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
