Please make our endeavor a success, my Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 10.72.4</B></A>: Purified persons who constantly serve, meditate upon and glorify Your shoes, which destroy everything inauspicious, are sure to obtain freedom from material existence, O lotus-naveled one. Even if they desire something in this world, they obtain it, whereas others &#8212; those who do not take shelter of You &#8212; are never satisfied, O Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 10.72.5</B></A>: Therefore, O Lord of lords, let the people of this world see the power of devotional service rendered to Your lotus feet.

Just like the heavenly desire tree, You bless all who properly worship You, granting their desired fruits in proportion to the service they render You. There is nothing wrong in this.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 10.72.7</B></A>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Your decision is perfect, O King, and thus your noble fame will spread to all the worlds, O tormentor of your enemies.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 10.72.8</B></A>: Indeed, My lord, for the great sages, the forefathers and the demigods, for Our well-wishing friends and, indeed, for all living beings, the performance of this king of Vedic sacrifices is desirable.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 10.72.9</B></A>: First conquer all kings, bring the earth under your control and collect all the required paraphernalia; then execute this great sacrifice.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 10.72.10</B></A>: These brothers of yours, O King, have taken birth as partial expansions of the demigods ruling various planets. And you are so self-controlled that you have conquered even Me, who am unconquerable for those who cannot control their senses.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 10.72.11</B></A>: No one in this world, even a demigod &#8212; what to speak of an earthly king &#8212; can defeat My devotee with his strength, beauty, fame or riches.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 10.72.12</B></A>: &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: Upon hearing these words sung by the Supreme Lord, King Yudhishthira became joyful, and his face blossomed like a lotus.

They submitted their entreaty to that dutiful householder, who was especially respectful to the brahminical class.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 10.72.18</B></A>: [Krishna, Arjuna and Bh&#299;ma said:] O King, know us to be needy guests who have come to you from afar. We wish all good unto you. Please grant us whatever we desire.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 10.72.19</B></A>: What can the tolerant not bear? What will the wicked not do?

He began to think he had seen them somewhere before.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>SB 10.72.23</B></A>: [Jar&#257;sandha thought:] These are surely members of the royal order dressed as br&#257;hmanas, but still I must grant their request for charity, even if they beg me for my own body.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24-25.htm"><B>SB 10.72.24-25</B></A>: Indeed, the spotless glories of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja are heard throughout the world. Lord Vishnu, wishing to recover Indra's opulence from Bali, appeared before him in the guise of a br&#257;hmana and made him fall from his powerful position.

I will give it to you, even if it is my own head."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 10.72.28</B></A>: The Supreme Lord said: O exalted King, give us battle in the form of a duel, if you think it fitting. We are princes and have come to beg a fight. We have no other request to make of you.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>SB 10.72.29</B></A>: Over there is Bh&#299;ma, son of Prith&#257;, and this is his brother Arjuna. Know Me to be their maternal cousin, Krishna, your enemy.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 10.72.30</B></A>: [&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continued:] Thus challenged, Magadhar&#257;ja laughed out loud and contemptuously said, "All right, you fools, I'll give you a fight!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 10.72.31</B></A>: "But I will not fight with You, Krishna, for You are a coward.
