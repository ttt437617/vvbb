The Lord asked her who she was and requested some ointment from her. Entranced by His beauty and joking words, Trivakr&#257; gave both Krishna and Balar&#257;ma a good deal of ointment. In return, Krishna stepped on her toes with His lotus feet, took hold of her chin and lifted, thus straightening her spine. The now beautiful and charming Trivakr&#257; then grabbed the edge of Krishna's upper cloth and asked Him to come to her house. Krishna replied that after He had taken care of some business He would certainly come and relieve her mental torment. Then the two Lords continued Their sightseeing tour of Mathur&#257;.</P><P>As Krishna and Balar&#257;ma walked along the King's road, the merchants worshiped Them with various offerings. Krishna asked where the bow sacrifice was to take place, and when He arrived at the arena He saw the wonderful bow, which resembled Lord Indra's. Despite the guards' protests, Krishna forcibly picked up the bow, easily strung it and in an instant broke it in half, producing an ear-splitting sound that filled the heavens and struck terror in the heart of Kamsa. The many guards attacked Krishna, crying out "Seize Him! Kill Him!" But Krishna and Balar&#257;ma simply picked up the two halves of the bow and beat the guards to death. Next the Lords annihilated a company of soldiers sent by Kamsa, and then They left the arena and continued Their tour.</P><P>When the people of the city saw the amazing prowess and beauty of Krishna and Balar&#257;ma, they thought They must be two chief demigods. Indeed, as the residents of Mathur&#257; gazed upon the Lords, they enjoyed all the blessings the gop&#299;s had predicted.</P><P>At sunset Krishna and Balar&#257;ma returned to the cowherds' camp for Their evening meal. They then passed the night resting comfortably. But King Kamsa was not so fortunate. When he heard how Krishna and Balar&#257;ma had easily broken the mighty bow and destroyed his soldiers, he spent the night in great anxiety. Both while awake and while dreaming he saw many ill omens portending his imminent death, and his fear ruined any chance for rest.</P><P>At dawn the wrestling festival began. Crowds of people from the city and outlying districts entered the arena and took their seats in the lavishly decorated galleries. Kamsa, his heart trembling, sat down on the royal dais and invited Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and the other cowherd men to come sit in their places, and they did so after offering him their gifts. The musical overture then began as the sounds of the wrestlers slapping their arms resounded.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../41/52.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
