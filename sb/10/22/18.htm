All the unmarried gop&#299;s who prayed to K&#257;ty&#257;yan&#299; to have Krishna as their husband were thus satisfied. A woman cannot be naked before any male except her husband. The unmarried gop&#299;s desired Krishna as their husband, and He fulfilled their desire in this way."</P><P>For aristocratic girls like the gop&#299;s, standing naked before a young boy was worse than death, and yet they decided to give up everything for the pleasure of Lord Krishna. He wanted to see the power of their love for Him, and He was completely satisfied by their unalloyed devotion.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
