The gop&#299;s, like all young girls from respectable families, considered the embarrassment of appearing naked before a young boy to be worse than giving up their lives. Yet Lord Krishna made them come out of the water and bow down to Him. Although the bodily forms of the gop&#299;s were all fully developed, and although Krishna met them in a secluded place and brought them fully under His control, because the Lord is completely transcendental there was not a trace of material desire in His mind. Lord Krishna is the ocean of transcendental bliss, and He wanted to share His bliss with the gop&#299;s on the spiritual platform, completely free of ordinary lust.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura explains that the companions of Krishna mentioned here were mere toddlers two or three years old. They were completely naked and were unaware of the difference between male and female. When Krishna went out to herd the cows, they followed Him because they were so attached to Him that they could not bear to be without His association.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
