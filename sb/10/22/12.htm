What is the difficulty?'</P><P>"When the gop&#299;s saw Krishna's determination, they were filled with loving ecstasy. Although embarrassed, they were overjoyed to receive such attention from Krishna. He was joking with them as if they were His wives or girlfriends, and the gop&#299;s' only desire was to achieve such a relationship with Him. At the same time, they were embarrassed to be seen naked by Him. But still they could not help laughing at His joking words and even began to joke among themselves, one gop&#299; urging another, 'Go ahead, you go first, and let us see if Krishna plays any tricks on you. Then we will go later.'
