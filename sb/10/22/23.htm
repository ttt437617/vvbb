Thus, even after putting their clothes on they did not move. They simply remained where they were, shyly glancing at Him.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>By association with their beloved Krishna, the gop&#299;s had become more attached to Him than ever. Just as Krishna had stolen their clothes, He had also stolen their minds and their love. The gop&#299;s interpreted the whole incident as proof that Krishna was also attached to them. Otherwise, why would He have gone to the trouble of playing with them in this way? Because they thought that Krishna was now attached to them, they glanced at Him with shyness, and being stunned by the rising of their ecstatic love, they could not move from where they stood. Krishna had overcome their shyness and forced them to come out of the water naked, but now, having dressed properly, they again became shy in His presence. In fact, this incident increased their humbleness before Krishna. They did not want Krishna to see them staring at Him, but they cautiously took the opportunity to glance at the Lord.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
