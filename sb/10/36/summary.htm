Everyone in Krishna's cowherd village became terrified when Arisht&#257;sura approached it, but the Lord pacified them, and when the bull demon charged Him He seized him by the horns and threw him about six yards. Though weakened, Arishta still wanted to attack Krishna. Thus, dripping with sweat, he charged the Lord once again. This time Krishna grabbed his horns, threw him to the ground and thrashed him like a pile of wet clothing. The demon vomited blood and gave up his life. Then Krishna and R&#257;ma, while being honored by the demigods and cowherd boys, returned to the village.</P><P>A short time later N&#257;rada Muni, the great sage among the demigods, came to see King Kamsa. He informed the King that Krishna and Balar&#257;ma were not Nanda's sons but rather Vasudeva's. It was out of fear of Kamsa that Vasudeva had put the two boys under Nanda's care. Furthermore, said N&#257;rada, Kamsa would meet his death at Their hands.</P><P>Kamsa shook with fear and anger when he heard all this, and in great agitation he began thinking of how to destroy Krishna and Balar&#257;ma. He called for the demons C&#257;n&#363;ra and Mushtika and instructed them to kill the two brothers in a wrestling match. Then he spoke to Akr&#363;ra, who was expert at executing his duties. Taking Akr&#363;ra by the hand, Kamsa persuaded him to go to Vraja to bring the two boys to Mathur&#257;. Akr&#363;ra agreed to carry out Kamsa's order and then returned home.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../35/26.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
