Appearing in the form of a bull with a large hump, he made the earth tremble as he tore it apart with his hooves.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>SB 10.36.2</B></A>: Arisht&#257;sura bellowed very harshly and pawed the ground. With his tail raised and his eyes glaring, he began to tear up the embankments with the tips of his horns, every now and then passing a little stool and urine.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3-4.htm"><B>SB 10.36.3-4</B></A>: My dear King, clouds hovered about sharp-horned Arisht&#257;sura's hump, mistaking it for a mountain, and when the cowherd men and ladies caught sight of the demon, they were struck with terror. Indeed, the strident reverberation of his roar so frightened the pregnant cows and women that they lost their fetuses in miscarriages.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 10.36.5</B></A>: The domestic animals fled the pasture in fear, O King, and all the inhabitants rushed to Lord Govinda for shelter, crying, "Krishna, Krishna!"</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 10.36.6</B></A>: When the Supreme Lord saw the cowherd community distraught and fleeing in fear, He calmed them, saying, "Don't be afraid." Then He called out to the bull demon as follows.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 10.36.7</B></A>: You fool! What do you think you're doing, you wicked rascal, frightening the cowherd community and their animals when I am here just to punish corrupt miscreants like you!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 10.36.8</B></A>: Having spoken these words, the infallible Lord Hari slapped His arms with His palms, further angering Arishta with the loud sound. The Lord then casually threw His mighty, serpentine arm over the shoulder of a friend and stood facing the demon.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 10.36.9</B></A>: Thus provoked, Arishta pawed the ground with one of his hooves and then, with the clouds hovering around his upraised tail, furiously charged Krishna.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 10.36.10</B></A>: Pointing the tips of his horns straight ahead and glaring menacingly at Lord Krishna from the corners of his bloodshot eyes, Arishta rushed toward Him at full speed, like a thunderbolt hurled by Indra.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 10.36.11</B></A>: The Supreme Lord Krishna seized Arisht&#257;sura by the horns and threw him back eighteen steps, just as an elephant might do when fighting a rival elephant.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 10.36.12</B></A>: Thus repulsed by the Supreme Lord, the bull demon got up and, breathing hard and sweating all over his body, again charged Him in a mindless rage.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 10.36.13</B></A>: As Arishta attacked, Lord Krishna seized him by the horns and knocked him to the ground with His foot. The Lord then thrashed him as if he were a wet cloth, and finally He yanked out one of the demon's horns and struck him with it until he lay prostrate.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 10.36.14</B></A>: Vomiting blood and profusely excreting stool and urine, kicking his legs and rolling his eyes about, Arisht&#257;sura thus went painfully to the abode of Death. The demigods honored Lord Krishna by scattering flowers upon Him.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 10.36.15</B></A>: Having thus killed the bull demon Arishta, He who is a festival for the gop&#299;s' eyes entered the cowherd village with Balar&#257;ma.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 10.36.16</B></A>: After Arisht&#257;sura had been killed by Krishna, who acts wonderfully, N&#257;rada Muni went to speak to King Kamsa. That powerful sage of godly vision addressed the King as follows.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 10.36.17</B></A>: [N&#257;rada told Kamsa:] Ya&#347;od&#257;'s child was actually a daughter, and Krishna is the son of Devak&#299;. Also, R&#257;ma is the son of Rohin&#299;. Out of fear, Vasudeva entrusted Krishna and Balar&#257;ma to his friend Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, and it is these two boys who have killed your men.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 10.36.18</B></A>: Upon hearing this, the master of the Bhojas became furious and lost control of his senses. He picked up a sharp sword to kill Vasudeva.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 10.36.19</B></A>: But N&#257;rada restrained Kamsa by reminding him that it was the two sons of Vasudeva who would cause his death. Kamsa then had Vasudeva and his wife shackled in iron chains.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 10.36.20</B></A>: After N&#257;rada left, King Kamsa summoned Ke&#347;&#299; and ordered him, "Go kill R&#257;ma and Krishna."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>SB 10.36.21</B></A>: The King of the Bhojas next called for his ministers, headed by Mushtika, C&#257;n&#363;ra, &#346;ala and To&#347;ala, and also for his elephant-keepers. The King addressed them as follows.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22-23.htm"><B>SB 10.36.22-23</B></A>: My dear heroic C&#257;n&#363;ra and Mushtika, please hear this. R&#257;ma and Krishna, the sons of &#256;nakadundubhi [Vasudeva], are living in Nanda's cowherd village. It has been predicted that these two boys will be the cause of my death.

In ritual slaughter offer the appropriate kinds of animals to the magnanimous Lord &#346;iva.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>SB 10.36.27</B></A>: Having thus commanded his ministers, Kamsa next called for Akr&#363;ra, the most eminent of the Yadus. Kamsa knew the art of securing personal advantage, and thus he took Akr&#363;ra's hand in his own and spoke to him as follows.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 10.36.28</B></A>: My dear Akr&#363;ra, most charitable one, please do me a friendly favor out of respect. Among the Bhojas and Vrishnis, there is no one else as kind to us as you.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>SB 10.36.29</B></A>: Gentle Akr&#363;ra, you always carry out your duties soberly, and therefore I am depending on you, just as powerful Indra took shelter of Lord Vishnu to achieve his goals.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 10.36.30</B></A>: Please go to Nanda's village, where the two sons of &#256;nakadundubhi are living, and without delay bring Them here on this chariot.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 10.36.31</B></A>: The demigods, who are under the protection of Vishnu, have sent these two boys as my death. Bring Them here, and also have Nanda and the other cowherd men come with gifts of tribute.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>SB 10.36.32</B></A>: After you bring Krishna and Balar&#257;ma, I will have Them killed by my elephant, who is as powerful as death itself. And if by chance They escape from him, I will have Them killed by my wrestlers, who are as strong as lightning.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>SB 10.36.33</B></A>: When these two have been killed, I will kill Vasudeva and all Their lamenting relatives &#8212; the Vrishnis, Bhojas and Da&#347;&#257;rhas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>SB 10.36.34</B></A>: I will also kill my old father, Ugrasena, who is greedy for my kingdom, and I will kill his brother Devaka and all my other enemies as well.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm"><B>SB 10.36.35</B></A>: Then, my friend, this earth will be free of thorns.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>SB 10.36.36</B></A>: My elder relative Jar&#257;sandha and my dear friend Dvivida are solid well-wishers of mine, as are &#346;ambara, Naraka and B&#257;na.

Still, one should be equal in success and failure, since it is certainly destiny that produces the results of one's work.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm"><B>SB 10.36.39</B></A>: An ordinary person is determined lo act on his desires even when fate prevents their fulfillment. Therefore he encounters both happiness and distress. Yet even though such is the case, I will execute your order.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm"><B>SB 10.36.40</B></A>: &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: Having thus instructed Akr&#363;ra, King Kamsa dismissed his ministers and retired to his quarters, and Akr&#363;ra returned home.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
