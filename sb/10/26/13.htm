And how is it that He is so spontaneously attracted to us?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The very word krishna means "the all-attractive one." The residents of Vrind&#257;vana could not give up their constant love (anur&#257;ga) for Lord Krishna. Their attitude toward Him was not particularly theistic, because they were unsure whether He was God or not. But He attracted all their love precisely because as God He is the all-attractive person, the supreme object of our love.</P><P>The cowherd men also asked, "How is it that young Krishna feels such constant love for us?" In fact the Supreme Lord loves all living beings, who are eternally His children. At the end of the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, Lord Krishna dramatically declares His affection for Arjuna and urges Arjuna to reciprocate that love by surrendering to Him. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, in His prayers to Lord Krishna, states, et&#257;dri&#347;&#299; tava krip&#257; bhagavan mam&#257;pi durdaivam &#299;dri&#347;am ih&#257;jani n&#257;nur&#257;gah: "My Lord, You are so merciful toward Me, but I am so unfortunate that love for You has not awakened within Me." (&#346;iksh&#257;shtaka 2) In this statement &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu also uses the word anur&#257;ga. Our misfortune is that we cannot reciprocate the anur&#257;ga, or loving affection, that the Lord feels for us. Although we are infinitesimal and insignificant and the Lord is infinitely attractive, somehow we do not give Him our love. We must accept responsibility for this foolish decision, since to surrender to God or not is the essential expression of our free will.</P><P>The Krishna consciousness movement provides an efficient, systematic program to help conditioned souls revive their original, blissful consciousness, which is love of God, Krishna consciousness. The intricacies of Krishna consciousness are so wonderful that even Krishna's eternal associates, the residents of Vrind&#257;vana, are astonished by them, as shown by these verses.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
