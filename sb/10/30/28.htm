He comments, "The sage &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has tried with all endeavor to keep Her name hidden, but now it automatically shines forth from the moon of his mouth. That he has spoken Her name is indeed Her mercy, and thus the word &#257;r&#257;dhitah is like the rumbling of a kettledrum sounded to announce Her great good fortune."</P><P>Although the gop&#299;s spoke as if jealous of &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;, they were actually ecstatic to see that She had captured &#346;r&#299; Krishna.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; quotes the following detailed description of &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;'s footprints, as given by &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; in his &#346;r&#299; Ujjvala-n&#299;lamani: "At the base of the large toe of Her left foot is the mark of a barleycorn, below that mark is a disc, below the disc is an umbrella, and below the umbrella is a bracelet. A vertical line extends from the middle of Her foot to the juncture of Her large and second toes. At the base of the middle toe is a lotus, below that is a flag with a banner, and below the flag is a creeper, together with a flower. At the base of Her small toe is an elephant goad, and upon Her heel is a half-moon. Thus there are eleven marks on Her left foot.</P><P>"At the base of the large toe of Her right foot is a conchshell, and below that a spear. At the base of the small toe of Her right foot is a sacrificial altar, below that an earring, and below the earring a spear. Along the base of the second, third, fourth and small toes is the mark of a mountain, below which is a chariot, and on the heel is a fish.</P><P>"Thus all together there are nineteen distinguishing marks on the soles of &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;'s lotus feet."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
