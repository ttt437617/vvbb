Even with the greatest endeavor I cannot maintain My life. But You are the Lord of My life, and so You can quickly save Me simply by glancing upon Me. Please do so immediately. I beg You to save My life, not for My sake but rather for Yours. After giving up all the other gop&#299;s, You've brought Me so far to a secluded place in the forest just to enjoy special pleasure with Me. If I die You will not be able to find conjugal happiness anywhere else. You will remember Me and thus lament in Your sorrow.'</P><P>"Krishna replies, 'So let Me become unhappy. What does that matter to You?'</P><P>" 'But You are most dear to Me. I will feel Your unhappiness millions of times more than You. Even if I've already died, I still will not be able to tolerate the pain that even one spot on the nails of Your lotus feet may experience. Indeed, to prevent such pain I am ready to throw My life away millions and millions of times. So kindly show Yourself and drive away that unhappiness.'</P><P>" 'But if Your life air is on the verge of leaving Your body, what can I do to stop that?'</P><P>" 'Simply by the touch of Your arms, which are a medicinal herb with the power to revive the dead, My body will return to its healthy, normal condition, and My life air will automatically come back and remain in My body.'</P><P>" 'But You know the forest path Yourself without My help, so why did You order Me, the king's son and a very young and gentle boy who is to be respected? Why did You command, "Take Me wherever You wish"? Why do You anger Me like this?'</P><P>"R&#257;dh&#257; cries out, 'Please show Yourself to Your wretched maidservant. Be merciful to Me! Be merciful! When I ordered You, I was overcome by sleepiness. I was so tired from playing with You. Therefore please excuse what Your poor servant said. Please don't be angry. It was only because You treated Me like such a close friend, though I am unworthy, that I spoke like that to You.'</P><P>" 'All right, My love, I am very pleased with You, so please come to Me.'</P><P>" 'But I've been blinded by lamentation. I can't see where You are. Please tell Me where You are.'
