Very much pleased by the sound of other people's ankle bells, They used to follow these people as if going to Their mothers, but when They saw that these were other people, They became afraid and returned to Their real mothers, Ya&#347;od&#257; and Rohin&#299;.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>When Krishna and Balar&#257;ma were crawling about Vrajabh&#363;mi, They were enchanted by the sound of ankle bells. Thus They sometimes followed other people, who would enjoy the crawling of Krishna and Balar&#257;ma and exclaim, "Oh, see how Krishna and Balar&#257;ma are crawling!" Upon hearing this, Krishna and Balar&#257;ma could understand that these were not Their mothers They were following, and They would return to Their actual mothers. Thus the crawling of Krishna and Balar&#257;ma was enjoyed by the people of the neighborhood, as well as by mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Rohin&#299; and the two children Themselves.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
