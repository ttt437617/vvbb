These are known to me, but people in general do not understand them.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Bah&#363;ni: the Lord has many names. Advaitam acyutam an&#257;dim ananta-r&#363;pam &#257;dyam pur&#257;na-purusham nava-yauvanam ca. As stated in the Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/33.htm">5.33</A>), the Lord is one, but He has many forms and many names. It was not that because Gargamuni gave the child the name Krishna, that was His only name. He has other names, such as Bhaktavatsala, Giridh&#257;r&#299;, Govinda and Gop&#257;la. If we analyze the nirukti, or semantic derivation, of the word "Krishna," we find that na signifies that He stops the repetition of birth and death, and krish means satt&#257;rtha, or "existence." (Krishna is the whole of existence.) Also, krish means "attraction," and na means &#257;nanda, or "bliss." Krishna is known as Mukunda because He wants to give everyone spiritual, eternal, blissful life. Unfortunately, because of the living entity's little independence, the living entity wants to "deprogram" the program of Krishna. This is the material disease. Nonetheless, because Krishna wants to give transcendental bliss to the living entities, He appears in various forms. Therefore He is called Krishna. Because Gargamuni was an astrologer, he knew what others did not know. Yet Krishna has so many names that even Gargamuni did not know them all. It is to be concluded that Krishna, according to His transcendental activities, has many names and many forms.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
