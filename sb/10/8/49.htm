Whenever there is a necessity of Krishna's appearance, Drona and Dhar&#257; appear first, and then Krishna appears. Krishna says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; that His birth is not ordinary (janma karma ca me divyam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/9.htm">Bg. 4.9</A>]).</P><P>ajo 'pi sann avyay&#257;tm&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m &#299;&#347;varo 'pi san</P><P CLASS=n>prakritim sv&#257;m adhishth&#257;ya</P><P CLASS=n>sambhav&#257;my &#257;tma-m&#257;yay&#257;</P><P>"Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/6.htm">Bg. 4.6</A>) Before Krishna's appearance, Drona and Dhar&#257; appear in order to become His father and mother. It is they who appear as Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and his wife, Ya&#347;od&#257;. In other words, it is not possible for a s&#257;dhana-siddha living being to become the father or mother of Krishna, for Krishna's father and mother are already designated. But by following the principles exhibited by Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Ya&#347;od&#257; and their associates, the inhabitants of Vrind&#257;vana, ordinary living beings may attain such affection as exhibited by Nanda and Ya&#347;od&#257;.</P><P>When Drona and Dhar&#257; were requested to beget children, they chose to come to this world to have the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son, Krishna. Krishna's appearance means paritr&#257;n&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;m vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca dushkrit&#257;m [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/8.htm">Bg. 4.8</A>] &#8212; the devotees are protected, and the miscreants are vanquished. Whenever Krishna comes, He distributes the highest goal of life, devotional service. He appears as Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu for the same purpose because unless one comes to devotional service, one cannot be delivered from the miseries of the material world (duhkh&#257;layam a&#347;&#257;&#347;vatam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/8/15.htm">Bg. 8.15</A>]), where the living beings struggle for existence. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/7.htm">15.7</A>):</P><P>mamaiv&#257;m&#347;o j&#299;va-loke</P><P CLASS=n>j&#299;va-bh&#363;tah san&#257;tanah</P><P CLASS=n>manah shashth&#257;n&#299;ndriy&#257;ni</P><P CLASS=n>prakriti-sth&#257;ni karshati</P><P>"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Because of conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." The living entities are struggling to become happy, but unless they take to the bhakti cult, their happiness is not possible. Krishna clearly says:</P><P>a&#347;raddadh&#257;n&#257;h purush&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>dharmasy&#257;sya parantapa</P><P CLASS=n>apr&#257;pya m&#257;m nivartante</P><P CLASS=n>mrityu-sams&#257;ra-vartmani</P><P>"Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/3.htm">Bg. 9.3</A>)</P><P>Foolish persons do not know how risky life is here if one does not follow the instructions of Krishna. The Krishna consciousness movement, therefore, has been started so that by practicing Krishna consciousness one can avoid the risky life of this material existence. There is no question of accepting or not accepting Krishna consciousness. It is not optional; it is compulsory. If we do not take to Krishna consciousness, our life is very risky. Everything is explained in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. Therefore, to learn how to become free from the miserable condition of material existence, Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; As It Is is the preliminary study. Then, if one understands Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, one can proceed to &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, and if one advances further, one may study Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita. We are therefore presenting these invaluable books to the whole world so that people may study them and be happy, being delivered from miserable conditional life.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
