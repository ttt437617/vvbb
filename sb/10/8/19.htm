In His transcendental qualities, opulence, name, fame and influence, He is exactly like N&#257;r&#257;yana. You should all raise this child very carefully and cautiously.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In this verse, the word n&#257;r&#257;yana-samah is significant. N&#257;r&#257;yana has no equal. He is asamaurdhva: no one is equal to Him, and no one is greater than He is. As stated in &#347;&#257;stra:</P><P>yas tu n&#257;r&#257;yanam devam</P><P CLASS=n>brahma-rudr&#257;di-daivataih</P><P CLASS=n>samatvenaiva v&#299;ksheta</P><P CLASS=n>sa p&#257;shand&#299; bhaved dhruvam</P><P>One who equates N&#257;r&#257;yana even with great exalted demigods like Lord &#346;iva or Lord Brahm&#257; is a p&#257;shand&#299;, an agnostic. No one can equal N&#257;r&#257;yana. Nonetheless, Gargamuni used the word sama, meaning "equal," because he wanted to treat Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who had become Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja's son. Gargamuni wanted to impress upon the mind of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, "Your worshipable Deity, N&#257;r&#257;yana, is so pleased with you that He has sent you a son almost equal to Him in qualifications. Therefore you may designate your son with a similar name, such as Mukunda or Madhus&#363;dana. But you must always remember that whenever you want to do something very good, there will be many hindrances. Therefore you should raise and protect this child with great care. If you can protect this child very cautiously, as N&#257;r&#257;yana always protects you, the child will be as good as N&#257;r&#257;yana." Gargamuni also indicated that although the child was exaltedly qualified like N&#257;r&#257;yana, He would enjoy more than N&#257;r&#257;yana as r&#257;sa-vih&#257;r&#299;, the central enjoyer of the r&#257;sa dance. As stated in the Brahma-samhit&#257;, lakshm&#299;-sahasra-&#347;ata-sambhrama-sevyam&#257;nam: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/29.htm">Bs. 5.29</A>] He would be served by many gop&#299;s, who would all be as good as the goddess of fortune.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
