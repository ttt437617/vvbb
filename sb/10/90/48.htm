He is the guide of the Yadu dynasty, and with His mighty arms He kills everything inauspicious, as well as every man who is impious.

May He be all glorious and happy!</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da's English rendering of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/13/79.htm">Madhya 13.79</A>). According to &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has composed this beautiful verse to console those who lament the fact that Lord Krishna did not continue to manifest His intimate pastimes down to the present time. Here &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva reminds his listeners that the Lord is eternally present in this world &#8212; in His holy abode, His name and the recitation of His glories. This idea is expressed by the word jayati ("He is victorious"), which is in the present tense rather than the past.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da explains this verse as follows in Krishna: "&#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; thus concludes his description of the superexalted position of Lord Krishna by glorifying Him in the following way: 'O Lord Krishna, all glories unto You. You are present in everyone's heart as Param&#257;tm&#257;. Therefore You are known as Jananiv&#257;sa, one who lives in everyone's heart.' As confirmed in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, &#299;&#347;varah sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m hrid-de&#347;e 'rjuna tishthati: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/61.htm">Bg. 18.61</A>] The Supreme Lord in His Param&#257;tm&#257; feature lives in everyone's heart. This does not mean, however, that Krishna has no separate existence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers accept the all-pervading feature of Parabrahman, but when Parabrahman, or the Supreme Lord, appears, they think that He appears under the control of material nature. Because Lord Krishna appeared as the son of Devak&#299;, the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers accept Krishna to be an ordinary living entity who takes birth within this material world. Therefore &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; warns them: devak&#299;-janma-v&#257;dah, which means that although Krishna is famous as the son of Devak&#299;, actually He is the Supersoul, or the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P>"The devotees, however, take this word devak&#299;-janma-v&#257;dah in a different way. The devotees understand that actually Krishna was the son of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. Although Krishna first of all appeared as the son of Devak&#299;, He immediately transferred Himself to the lap of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, and His childhood pastimes were blissfully enjoyed by mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. This fact was also admitted by Vasudeva himself when he met Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Ya&#347;od&#257; at Kurukshetra. He admitted that Krishna and Balar&#257;ma were actually the sons of mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. Vasudeva and Devak&#299; were only Their official father and mother....</P><P>"&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; then glorifies the Lord as one who is honored by the yadu-vara-parishat, the assembly house of the Yadu dynasty, and as the killer of different kinds of demons. Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have killed all the demons by employing His different material energies, but He wanted to kill them personally in order to give them salvation. There was no need of Krishna's coming to this material world to kill the demons. Simply by His willing, many hundreds and thousands of demons could have been killed without His personal endeavor. But actually He descended for His pure devotees, to play as a child with mother Ya&#347;od&#257; and Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and to give pleasure to the inhabitants of Dv&#257;rak&#257;. By killing the demons and by giving protection to the devotees, Lord Krishna established the real religious principle, which is simply love of God. By following the factual religious principles of love of God, even the living entities known as sthira-cara were also delivered from all material contamination and were transferred to the spiritual kingdom. Sthira means the trees and plants, which cannot move, and cara means the moving animals, specifically the cows. When Krishna was present, He delivered all the trees, monkeys and other plants and animals who happened to see Him and serve Him both in Vrind&#257;vana and Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</P><P>"Lord Krishna is especially glorified for His giving pleasure to the gop&#299;s and the queens of Dv&#257;rak&#257;. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; glorifies Lord Krishna for His enchanting smile, by which He enchanted not only the gop&#299;s of Vrind&#257;vana but also the queens at Dv&#257;rak&#257;. The exact words used in this connection are vardhayan k&#257;madevam. In Vrind&#257;vana as the boyfriend of many gop&#299;s and in Dv&#257;rak&#257; as the husband of many queens, Krishna increased their lusty desires to enjoy with Him. For God realization or self-realization, one generally has to undergo severe austerities and penances for many, many thousands of years, and then it may be possible to realize God. But the gop&#299;s and the queens of Dv&#257;rak&#257;, simply by enhancing their lusty desires to enjoy Krishna as their boyfriend or husband, received the highest type of salvation."</P><P>In this way &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da wonderfully illuminates the meaning of this verse by &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, which summarizes Lord Krishna's pastimes.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
