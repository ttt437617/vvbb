They were never afraid, good lady, because you protected Them just as eyelids protect the eyes. Indeed, saintly persons like you never discriminate between outsiders and their own kin.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>As &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; explains, Krishna and Balar&#257;ma had not seen Their parents for two reasons: because of Their exile in Vraja, and also because They are never actually born and therefore have no parents.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; also describes what Devak&#299; thought before speaking this verse: "Alas, because for so long these two sons of mine had you, Ya&#347;od&#257;, as Their guardian and mother, and because They were immersed in such a vast ocean of ecstatic loving dealings with you, now that you are once more before Them They are too distracted to even notice me. Also, you are behaving as if insane and blind with love for Them, showing millions of times more maternal affection than I possess. Thus you simply keep staring at us, your friends, without recognizing us. So let me bring you back to reality on the pretext of some affectionate words."</P><P>Then, when Devak&#299; failed to get any response from Ya&#347;od&#257; even after addressing her, Rohin&#299; said, "My dear Devak&#299;, it's impossible just now to rouse her out of this ecstatic trance. We are crying in the wilderness, and her two sons are no less bound up in the ropes of affection for her than she is for Them. So let us now go outside to meet with Prith&#257;, Draupad&#299; and the others."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
