Actually, You are the knower and seer of all things. Indeed, You are the Lord of all the universes, and yet I offer this one universe unto You.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In his Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da has quoted Lord Brahm&#257; as follows: "My dear Lord, although You are the Supreme Lord of all creation, I sometimes falsely think that I am the master of this universe. I may be master of this universe, but there are innumerable universes, and there are also innumerable Brahm&#257;s who preside over these universes. But actually You are the master of them all. As the Supersoul in everyone's heart, You know everything. Please, therefore, accept me as Your surrendered servant. I hope that You will excuse me for disturbing You in Your pastimes with Your friends and calves. Now if You will kindly allow me, I will immediately leave so You can enjoy Your friends and calves without my presence."</P><P>The words sarvam tvam vetsi sarva-drik are very significant here. Lord Krishna knows everything and sees everything, and therefore Lord Brahm&#257; did not need to remain in Vrind&#257;vana to maintain his personal loving contact with the Lord. In fact, as the creator of the universe, Lord Brahm&#257; was somewhat out of place in the simple, blissful atmosphere of Vrind&#257;vana, where Lord Krishna was exhibiting His supreme opulences in herding cows, enjoying picnics, playing games and so on.</P><P>Upon seeing the intense love the residents of Vrind&#257;vana had for Lord Krishna, Brahm&#257; felt unqualified to remain there. He was not eager to give up the Lord's association, but he felt it better to return to his personal devotional service in Brahmaloka. Somewhat embarrassed and unhappy over his foolish attempt at bewildering the Lord, Brahm&#257; preferred to resume his transcendental loving service rather than try to enjoy the Lord's presence.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
