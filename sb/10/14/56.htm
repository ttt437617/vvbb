Such enlightened persons recognize no reality apart from the Supreme Lord Krishna.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Everything exists within Lord Krishna, and Lord Krishna exists within everything. Still, the order of progression is always from the energetic to the expanded energy. Lord Krishna is the original identity, from whom all other identities emanate. He is the supreme energetic, from whom all categories and dimensions of energy become manifest. Thus, our personal bodies, self, family, friends, nation, planet, universe and so on are all manifestations of the Supreme Lord, who expands Himself through His personal potencies. Lord Krishna is certainly the supreme object of our love and attraction, and other objects, such as body, family and home, should be secondary objects of our affection. Moreover, a close analytic study of the actual situation will reveal that even the secondary objects of love are also manifestations of Lord Krishna. The conclusion is that Lord Krishna is our only friend and object of love.</P><P>In his Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da comments on this verse as follows: "Without being an expansion of Krishna, nothing can be attractive. Whatever is attractive within the cosmic manifestation is due to Krishna. Krishna is therefore the reservoir of all pleasure. The active principle of everything is Krishna, and highly elevated transcendentalists see everything in connection with Him. In the Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita it is stated that a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata, a highly advanced devotee, sees Krishna as the active principle in all movable and immovable living entities. Therefore he sees everything within this cosmic manifestation in relation to Krishna."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="57.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
