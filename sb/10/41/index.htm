He informed King Kamsa of the success of his mission and then went home.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 10.41.19</B></A>: Lord Krishna desired to see Mathur&#257;, so toward evening He took Lord Balar&#257;ma and the cowherd boys with Him and entered the city.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20-23.htm"><B>SB 10.41.20-23</B></A>: The Lord saw Mathur&#257;, with its tall gates and household entrances made of crystal, its immense archways and main doors of gold, its granaries and other storehouses of copper and brass, and its impregnable moats. Beautifying the city were pleasant gardens and parks. The main intersections were fashioned of gold, and there were mansions with private pleasure gardens, along with guildhalls and many other buildings. Mathur&#257; resounded with the calls of peacocks and pet turtledoves, who sat in the small openings of the lattice windows and on the gem-studded floors, and also on the columned balconies and on the ornate rafters in front of the houses. These balconies and rafters were adorned with vaid&#363;rya stones, diamonds, crystal quartz, sapphires, coral, pearls and emeralds. All the royal avenues and commercial streets were sprinkled with water, as were the side roads and courtyards, and flower garlands, newly grown sprouts, parched grains and rice had been scattered about everywhere. Gracing the houses' doorways were elaborately decorated pots filled with water, which were bedecked with mango leaves, smeared with yogurt and sandalwood paste, and encircled by flower petals and ribbons. Near the pots were flags, rows of lamps, bunches of flowers and the trunks of banana and betel-nut trees.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>SB 10.41.24</B></A>: The women of Mathur&#257; hurriedly assembled and went forth to see the two sons of Vasudeva as They entered the city on the King's road, surrounded by Their cowherd boyfriends.

He walked with the gait of a lordly elephant in rut, creating a festival for their eyes with His transcendental body, which is the source of pleasure for the divine goddess of fortune.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>SB 10.41.28</B></A>: The ladies of Mathur&#257; had repeatedly heard about Krishna, and thus as soon as they saw Him their hearts melted. They felt honored that He was sprinkling upon them the nectar of His glances and broad smiles. Taking Him into their hearts through their eyes, they embraced Him, the embodiment of all ecstasy, and as their bodily hairs stood on end, O subduer of enemies, they forgot the unlimited distress caused by His absence.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>SB 10.41.29</B></A>: Their lotus faces blooming with affection, the ladies who had climbed to the roofs of the mansions rained down showers of flowers upon Lord Balar&#257;ma and Lord Krishna.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>SB 10.41.30</B></A>: Br&#257;hmanas standing along the way honored the two Lords with presentations of yogurt, unbroken barleycorns, pots full of water, garlands, fragrant substances such as sandalwood paste, and other items of worship.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>SB 10.41.31</B></A>: The women of Mathur&#257; exclaimed: Oh, what severe austerities the gop&#299;s must have performed to be able to regularly see Krishna and Balar&#257;ma, who are the greatest source of pleasure for all mankind!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>SB 10.41.32</B></A>: Seeing a washerman approaching who had been dyeing some clothes, Krishna asked him for the finest laundered garments he had.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>SB 10.41.33</B></A>: [Lord Krishna said:] Please give suitable garments to the two of Us, who certainly deserve them. If you grant this charity, you will undoubtedly receive the greatest benefit.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>SB 10.41.34</B></A>: Thus requested by the Supreme Lord, who is perfectly complete in all respects, that arrogant servant of the King became angry and replied insultingly.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm"><B>SB 10.41.35</B></A>: [The washerman said:] You impudent boys! You're accustomed to roaming the mountains and forests, and yet You would dare put on such clothes as these! These are the King's possessions You're asking for!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>SB 10.41.36</B></A>: Fools, get out of here quickly! Don't beg like this if You want to stay alive. When someone is too bold, the King's men arrest him and kill him and take all his property.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>SB 10.41.37</B></A>: As the washerman thus spoke brazenly, the son of Devak&#299; became angry, and then merely with His fingertips He separated the man's head from his body.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm"><B>SB 10.41.38</B></A>: The washerman's assistants all dropped their bundles of clothes and fled down the road, scattering in all directions. Lord Krishna then took the clothes.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm"><B>SB 10.41.39</B></A>: Krishna and Balar&#257;ma put on pairs of garments that especially pleased Them, and then Krishna distributed the remaining clothes among the cowherd boys, leaving some scattered on the ground.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm"><B>SB 10.41.40</B></A>: Thereupon a weaver came forward and, feeling affection for the Lords, nicely adorned Their attire with cloth ornaments of various colors.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm"><B>SB 10.41.41</B></A>: Krishna and Balar&#257;ma looked resplendent, each in His own unique, wonderfully ornamented outfit. They resembled a pair of young elephants, one white and the other black, decorated for a festive occasion.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm"><B>SB 10.41.42</B></A>: Pleased with the weaver, the Supreme Lord Krishna blessed him that after death he would achieve the liberation of attaining a form like the Lord's, and that while in this world he would enjoy supreme opulence, physical strength, influence, memory and sensory vigor.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm"><B>SB 10.41.43</B></A>: The two Lords then went to the house of the garland-maker Sud&#257;m&#257;. When Sud&#257;m&#257; saw Them he at once stood up and then bowed down, placing his head on the ground.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm"><B>SB 10.41.44</B></A>: After offering Them seats and bathing Their feet, Sud&#257;m&#257; worshiped Them and Their companions with arghya, garlands, p&#257;n, sandalwood paste and other presentations.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm"><B>SB 10.41.45</B></A>: [Sud&#257;m&#257; said:] O Lord, my birth is now sanctified and my family free of contamination. Now that You both have come here, my forefathers, the demigods and the great sages are certainly all satisfied with me.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm"><B>SB 10.41.46</B></A>: You two Lords are the ultimate cause of this entire universe. To bestow sustenance and prosperity upon this realm, You have descended with Your plenary expansions.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm"><B>SB 10.41.47</B></A>: Because You are the well-wishing friends and Supreme Soul of the whole universe, You regard all with unbiased vision. Therefore, although You reciprocate Your devotees' loving worship, You always remain equally disposed toward all living beings.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm"><B>SB 10.41.48</B></A>: Please order me, Your servant, to do whatever You wish.

Thus with great pleasure he presented Them with garlands of fresh, fragrant flowers.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm"><B>SB 10.41.50</B></A>: Beautifully adorned with these garlands, Krishna and Balar&#257;ma were delighted, and so were Their companions. The two Lords then offered the surrendered Sud&#257;m&#257;, who was bowing down before Them, whatever benedictions he desired.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm"><B>SB 10.41.51</B></A>: Sud&#257;m&#257; chose unshakable devotion for Krishna, the Supreme Soul of all existence; friendship with His devotees; and transcendental compassion for all living beings.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm"><B>SB 10.41.52</B></A>: Not only did Lord Krishna grant Sud&#257;m&#257; these benedictions, but He also awarded him strength, long life, fame, beauty and ever-increasing prosperity for his family.
