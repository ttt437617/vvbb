Thus they join together and sing as follows: "The beauty of Krishna attracts the minds of all. When He stands in His threefold-bending way and plays upon His flute, the Siddhas' wives, flying in the sky with their husbands, become attracted to Him and forget external reality. The bulls, cows and other animals in the pasture become stunned in ecstasy, and they stand so still, with the grass unchewed between their teeth, that they appear like figures in a drawing. Indeed, even the unconscious rivers stop flowing.</P><P>"Just see! When Krishna dresses Himself in forest array and calls the cows' names by blowing on His flute, even the trees and creepers become so ecstatic out of love that their limbs display eruptions and their sap pours down like a torrent of tears. The sound of Krishna's flute causes the cranes, swans and other birds in the lakes to close their eyes in deep meditation, the clouds in the sky to gently rumble, imitating the flute's vibration, and even such great authorities in the science of music as Indra, Siva and Brahm&#257; to become astonished. And just as we gop&#299;s are anxious to offer everything we have to Krishna, so the wives of the black deer follow Him about, imitating us.</P><P>"When Krishna is returning to Vraja, He constantly plays His flute while His young companions chant His glories, and Brahm&#257; and other chief demigods come to worship His lotus feet."</P><P>Thus the gop&#299;s, feeling intense separation from Krishna, sing of His pastimes.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../34/32.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
