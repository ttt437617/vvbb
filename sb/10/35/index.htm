At that time the demigoddesses traveling in the sky with their husbands, the Siddhas, become amazed. As those ladies listen, they are embarrassed to find their minds yielding to the pursuit of lusty desires, and in their distress they are unaware that the belts of their garments are loosening.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4-5.htm"><B>SB 10.35.4-5</B></A>: O girls! This son of Nanda, who gives joy to the distressed, bears steady lightning on His chest and has a smile like a jeweled necklace. Now please hear something wonderful. When He vibrates His flute, Vraja's bulls, deer and cows, standing in groups at a great distance, are all captivated by the sound, and they stop chewing the food in their mouths and cock their ears. Stunned, they appear as if asleep, or like figures in a painting.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6-7.htm"><B>SB 10.35.6-7</B></A>: My dear gop&#299;, sometimes Mukunda imitates the appearance of a wrestler by decorating Himself with leaves, peacock feathers and colored minerals. Then, in the company of Balar&#257;ma and the cowherd boys, He plays His flute to call the cows. At that time the rivers stop flowing, their water stunned by the ecstasy they feel as they eagerly wait for the wind to bring them the dust of His lotus feet. But like us, the rivers are not very pious, and thus they merely wait with their arms trembling out of love.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8-11.htm"><B>SB 10.35.8-11</B></A>: Krishna moves about the forest in the company of His friends, who vividly chant the glories of His magnificent deeds. He thus appears just like the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibiting His inexhaustible opulences. When the cows wander onto the mountainsides and Krishna calls out to them with the sound of His flute, the trees and creepers in the forest respond by becoming so luxuriant with fruits and flowers that they seem to be manifesting Lord Vishnu within their hearts. As their branches bend low with the weight, the filaments on their trunks and vines stand erect out of the ecstasy of love of God, and both the trees and the creepers pour down a rain of sweet sap.Maddened by the divine, honeylike aroma of the tulas&#299; flowers on the garland Krishna wears, swarms of bees sing loudly for Him, and that most beautiful of all persons thankfully acknowledges and acclaims their song by taking His flute to His lips and playing it. The charming flute song then steals away the minds of the cranes, swans and other lake-dwelling birds. Indeed they approach Krishna, close their eyes and, maintaining strict silence, worship Him by fixing their consciousness upon Him in deep meditation.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12-13.htm"><B>SB 10.35.12-13</B></A>: O goddesses of Vraja, when Krishna is enjoying Himself with Balar&#257;ma on the mountain slopes, playfully wearing a flower garland on the top of His head, He engladdens all with the resonant vibrations of His flute. Thus He delights the entire world. At that time the nearby cloud, afraid of offending a great personality, thunders very gently in accompaniment. The cloud showers flowers onto his dear friend Krishna and shades Him from the sun like an umbrella.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14-15.htm"><B>SB 10.35.14-15</B></A>: O pious mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, your son, who is expert in all the arts of herding cows, has invented many new styles of flute-playing. When He takes His flute to His bimba-red lips and sends forth the tones of the harmonic scale in variegated melodies, Brahm&#257;, &#346;iva, Indra and other chief demigods become confused upon hearing the sound. Although they are the most learned authorities, hey cannot ascertain the essence of that music, and thus they bow down their heads and hearts.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16-17.htm"><B>SB 10.35.16-17</B></A>: As Krishna strolls through Vraja with His lotus-petal-like feet, marking the ground with the distinctive emblems of flag, thunderbolt, lotus and elephant goad, He relieves the distress the ground feels from the cows' hooves. As He plays His renowned flute, His body moves with the grace of an elephant. Thus we gop&#299;s, who become agitated by Cupid when Krishna playfully glances at us, stand as still as trees, unaware that our hair and garments are slackening.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18-19.htm"><B>SB 10.35.18-19</B></A>: Now Krishna is standing somewhere counting His cows on a string of gems. He wears a garland of tulas&#299; flowers that bear the fragrance of His beloved, and He has thrown His arm over the shoulder of an affectionate cowherd boyfriend. As Krishna plays His flute and sings, the music attracts the black deer's wives, who approach that ocean of transcendental qualities and sit down beside Him. Just like us cowherd girls, they have given up all hope for happiness in family life.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20-21.htm"><B>SB 10.35.20-21</B></A>: O sinless Ya&#347;od&#257;, your darling child, the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nanda, has festively enhanced His attire with a jasmine garland, and He is now playing along the Yamun&#257; in the company of the cows and cowherd boys, amusing His dear companions. The gentle breeze honors Him with its soothing fragrance of sandalwood, while the various Upadevas, standing on all sides like panegyrists, offer their music, singing and gifts of tribute.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22-23.htm"><B>SB 10.35.22-23</B></A>: Out of great affection for the cows of Vraja, Krishna became the lifter of Govardhana Hill. At the end of the day, having rounded up all His own cows, He plays a song on His flute, while exalted demigods standing along the path worship His lotus feet and the cowherd boys accompanying Him chant His glories. His garland is powdered by the dust raised by the cows' hooves, and His beauty, enhanced by His fatigue, creates an ecstatic festival for everyone's eyes. Eager to fulfill His friends' desires, Krishna is the moon arisen from the womb of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24-25.htm"><B>SB 10.35.24-25</B></A>: As Krishna respectfully greets His well-wishing friends, His eyes roll slightly as if from intoxication. He wears a flower garland, and the beauty of His soft cheeks is accentuated by the brilliance of His golden earrings and the whiteness of His face, which has the color of a badara berry. With His cheerful face resembling the moon, lord of the night, the Lord of the Yadus moves with the grace of u regal elephant. Thus He returns in the evening, delivering the cows of Vraja from the heat of the day.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>SB 10.35.26</B></A>: &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: O King, thus during the daytime the women of Vrind&#257;vana took pleasure in continuously singing about the pastimes of Krishna, and those ladies' minds and hearts, absorbed in Him, were filled with great festivity.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
