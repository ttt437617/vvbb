And just as rivers merge into the ocean or the nectar from many different flowers blends into honey, so all these conditioned beings eventually merge back into You, the Supreme, along with their various names and qualities.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Without proper spiritual guidance, one may misunderstand the Vedas' description of the living entities emanating from the Lord to mean that they have come into being in this process and will eventually pass again into nonexistence. But if the living entities were to thus have only temporary existence, then when one of them would die his remaining karma would simply vanish without being used up, and when a soul would be born he would appear with unaccountable karma he had done nothing to earn. Furthermore, a living being's liberation would amount to the total eradication of his identity and being.</P><P>The truth is, however, that the soul's essence is one with Brahman's, just as the small portion of space contained within the walls of a clay pot is one in essence with the all-expanding sky. And like the making and breaking of a pot, the "birth" of an individual soul consists of his first becoming covered by a material body, and his "death," or liberation, consists of the destruction of his gross and subtle bodies once and for all. Certainly such "birth" and "death" take place only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord.</P><P>The combination of material nature and her controller that produces the numerous conditioned beings in material creation is likened here to the combination of water and air that produces countless bubbles of foam on the surface of the sea. Just as the efficient cause, air, impels the ingredient cause, water, to form itself into bubbles, so by His glance the Supreme Purusha inspires prakriti to transform herself into the array of material elements and the innumerable material forms manifest from those elements. Prakriti thus serves as the up&#257;d&#257;na-k&#257;rana, or ingredient cause, of creation. In the ultimate issue, however, since she is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord, it is the Lord alone who is the ingredient cause as well as the efficient cause. This is as stated in the Taittir&#299;ya Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/2/2/1">2.2.1</A>), tasm&#257;d v&#257; etasm&#257;d &#257;tmana &#257;k&#257;&#347;ah sambh&#363;tah: "From this Supreme Soul the ether evolved," and so 'k&#257;mayata bahu sy&#257;m praj&#257;yeya: "He desired, 'Let Me become many by expanding into progeny.' "</P><P>The individual j&#299;va souls are not created when "born" from the Supreme Lord and prakriti, nor are they destroyed when they "merge" back into the Lord, rejoining Him in the pleasure pastimes of His eternal kingdom. And in the same way as the infinitesimal j&#299;vas can appear to undergo birth and death without any factual change, the Supreme Lord can send forth and withdraw His emanations without Himself undergoing any transformation. Thus the Brihad-&#257;ranyaka Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/4/5/14">4.5.14</A>) affirms, avin&#257;&#347;i v&#257;re 'yam &#257;tm&#257;: "This &#257;tm&#257; is indeed indestructible" &#8212; a statement that can be applied to both the Supreme Soul and the subordinate j&#299;va soul.</P><P>As explained by &#346;r&#299;la &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;, the dissolution of the living being's material condition occurs in two ways, partial and complete. Partial dissolution occurs when the soul experiences dreamless sleep, when he leaves his body and when all souls reenter the body of Mah&#257;-Vishnu at the time of universal annihilation. These different types of dissolution are like the mixing of nectar brought by bees from different kinds of flowers. The different flavors of nectar represent the dormant individual karmic reactions of each living entity, which still exist but cannot easily be distinguished from one another. In contrast, the ultimate dissolution of the soul's material condition is his liberation from sams&#257;ra, which is like the flowing of rivers into the ocean. As the waters from different rivers merge together after entering the ocean and become indistinguishable from one another, so the false material designations of the j&#299;vas are given up at the time of liberation and all the liberated j&#299;vas once again become equally situated as servants of the Supreme Lord.</P><P>The Upanishads describe these dissolutions as follows: yath&#257; saumya madhu madhu-krito nistishthanti n&#257;n&#257;tyay&#257;n&#257;m vriksh&#257;n&#257;m ras&#257;n samavah&#257;ram ekat&#257;m sa&#324;gayanti. te yath&#257; tatra na vivekam labhante amushy&#257;ham vrikshasya raso 'smy amushy&#257;ham raso 'sm&#299;ty evam eva khalu saumyem&#257;h sarv&#257;h praj&#257;h sati sampadya na viduh sati sampady&#257;mahe: "My dear boy this [partial dissolution] resembles what happens when honeybees collect honey by extracting the nectar from the flowers of various kinds of trees and merge it all into a single mixture. Just as the mixed nectars cannot distinguish, 'I am the juice of such-and-such a flower,' or 'I am the juice of another flower,' so, dear boy, when all these living entities merge together they cannot consciously think, 'Now we have merged together.'
