But with the words of the Vedas You bind the nondevotees like animals, though they be vastly learned scholars. It is Your affectionate devotees who can purify themselves and others, not those who are inimical to You.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The personified Vedas have now set aside the erroneous philosophies of several contending schools: the asad-utpatti-v&#257;da of the Vai&#347;eshikas, who presume a material source of creation; the sad-vin&#257;&#347;a-vada of the Naiy&#257;yikas, who would deprive the liberated soul of consciousness; the sagunatva-bheda-v&#257;da of the S&#257;&#324;khyas, who isolate the soul from all his apparent qualities; the vipana-v&#257;da of the M&#299;m&#257;msakas, who condemn the soul to eternal involvement in the mundane commerce of karma; and the vivarta-v&#257;da of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, who denigrate the soul's real life in this world as a hallucination. Having rejected all these ideas, the personified Vedas now present the philosophy of devotional service, paricary&#257;-v&#257;da.</P><P>The Vaishnavas who accept this philosophy teach that the j&#299;va soul is an atomic particle of spiritual personality who possesses minute knowledge, is not independent and has no material qualities. Being minute, he is prone to come under the control of the material energy, where he suffers the pains of material life. He can end his suffering and regain the shelter of the Supreme Lord's divine, internal energy only by rendering devotional service to the Lord, not by engaging in fruitive work, mental speculation or any other process.</P><P>As Lord Krishna says in His own words,</P><P CLASS=n>bhakty&#257;ham ekay&#257; gr&#257;hyah</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;raddhay&#257;tm&#257; priyah sat&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>bhaktih pun&#257;ti man-nishth&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;va-p&#257;k&#257;n api sambhav&#257;t</P><P>"Only by practicing unalloyed devotional service with full faith in Me can one obtain Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am naturally dear to My devotees, who take Me as the only goal of their loving service. By engaging in such pure devotional service, even the dog-eaters can purify themselves from the contamination of their low birth." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/11/14/21.htm">11.14.21</A>)</P><P>Devotees of the Personality of Godhead worship Him as the shelter (niketa) of everything that exists (akhila-sattva). Moreover, these Vaishnava devotees themselves can be called akhila-sattva-niketa in the sense that their abode and shelter is the philosophic truth of the reality (sattvam) of both the material and spiritual worlds. Thus &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, in his Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra-bh&#257;shya, quotes the &#347;ruti-mantra: satyam hy evedam vi&#347;vam asrijata. "He created this world as real." And the Seventh Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../7/1/11.htm">7.1.11</A>) refers to the Supreme Lord as pradh&#257;na-pumbhy&#257;m naradeva satya-krit, "the creator of a real universe of matter and living entities."</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura points out yet another, more confidential, meaning of akhila-sattva-niketa: that the Supreme Lord's personal abodes are in no way khila, or imperfect, and so are called Vaikuntha, the realms free of anxiety and restriction. Vaishnavas whose devotional service the Lord has kindly accepted are so sure of His protection that they no longer fear death, which becomes for them just another easy step on the way back to their eternal home.</P><P>But are only devotees of the Supreme Lord eligible for liberation from the fear of death? Why are all other mystics and learned scholars disqualified? Here the &#347;rutis answer: "Anyone who is vimukha, who has not turned his face toward the Lord with hopeful expectation of His mercy, is bound up in illusion by the same words of the Vedas that enlighten the surrendered devotees." The Vedas themselves warn, tasya v&#257;k-tantir n&#257;m&#257;ni d&#257;m&#257;ni. tasyedam v&#257;c&#257; tanty&#257; n&#257;mabhir d&#257;mabhih sarvam sitam: "The threads of this transcendental sound form a string of sacred names, but also a set of binding ropes. With the rope of their injunctions, the Vedas tie up this entire world, leaving all beings fettered by false designations."</P><P>The reality of the soul and Supersoul is aparoksha, perceivable, but only to one with transcendental vision. Philosophers whose hearts are impure mistakenly presume that this truth is instead paroksha, that it can only be speculated upon and never experienced directly. The knowledge of such thinkers may help them dispel certain doubts and misconceptions about the lesser aspects of reality, but it is useless for transcending material illusion and approaching the Absolute Truth. As a general rule, only the devotees who faithfully render loving service unto the Supreme Lord up to the point of complete purification receive His grace in the form of aparoksha-jñ&#257;na, direct realization of His greatness and wonderful compassion. The Personality of Godhead is of course free to award His mercy even to the undeserving, as He does when He personally kills offensive demons, but He is much less inclined to bless M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s and other atheistic philosophers.</P><P>One should not think, however, that the devotees of Vishnu are ignorant because they may not be expert in philosophic analysis and argument. The soul's perfect realization is to be gained not through his own efforts at mental speculation but by receiving the Lord's favor. This we hear from Vedic authority (Katha Upanishad <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/2/2/23">2.2.23</A> and Mundaka Upanishad <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/3/2/3">3.2.3</A>):</P><P>n&#257;yam &#257;tm&#257; pravacanena labhyo</P><P CLASS=n>na medhay&#257; na bahun&#257; &#347;rutena</P><P CLASS=n>yam evaisha vrinute tena labhyas</P><P CLASS=n>tasyaisha &#257;tm&#257; vivrinute tan&#363;m sv&#257;m</P><P>"This Supreme Self cannot be reached by argumentation, or by applying one's independent brain power, or by studying many scriptures. Rather, he alone can achieve the Self whom the Self chooses to favor. To that person the Self reveals His own true, personal form."</P><P>Elsewhere the &#347;ruti describes the devotee's success: deh&#257;nte devah param brahma t&#257;rakam vyacashte. "At the end of this body's life, the sanctified soul perceives the Supreme Lord just as clearly as if seeing the stars in the sky." And in its last statement, the &#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/6/23">6.23</A>) offers this encouragement to aspiring Vaishnavas:</P><P>yasya deve par&#257; bhaktir</P><P CLASS=n>yath&#257; deve tath&#257; gurau</P><P CLASS=n>tasyaite kathit&#257; hy arth&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>prak&#257;&#347;ante mah&#257;tmanah</P><P CLASS=n>[<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/su6/23">&#346;U 6.23</A>]</P><P>"Unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed."</P><P>In this regard &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; cites other verses of &#346;r&#299; &#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/4/7">4.7-8</A> and <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/4/13">4.13</A>):</P><P>jushtam yad&#257; pa&#347;yaty anyam &#299;&#347;am</P><P CLASS=n>asya mahim&#257;nam iti v&#299;ta-&#347;okah</P><P CLASS=n>rico 'kshare pare vyoman</P><P CLASS=n>yasmin dev&#257; adhi vi&#347;ve nisheduh</P><P CLASS=n>yas tam veda kim ric&#257; karishyati</P><P CLASS=n>ya it tad vidus ta ime sam&#257;sate</P><P>"The Supreme Lord is He who is referred to by the mantras of the Rig Veda, who resides in the topmost, eternal sky, and who elevates His saintly devotees to share that same position.
