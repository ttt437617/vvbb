After he received these benedictions, his body, which had been almost entirely consumed, was revived with full beauty and a luster like gold. Nonetheless, he continued to be envious of Lord Vishnu, unable to forget Lord Vishnu's having killed his brother. Hiranyaka&#347;ipu conquered everyone in the ten directions and the three worlds and brought all living entities, both demigods and asuras, under his control. Becoming the master of all places, including the residence of Indra, whom he had driven out, he began enjoying life in great luxury and thus became mad. All the demigods but Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva came under his control and began serving him, but despite all his material power he was dissatisfied because he was always puffed up, proud of transgressing the Vedic regulations. All the br&#257;hmanas were dissatisfied with him, and they cursed him with determination. Eventually, all the living entities within the universe, represented by the demigods and sages, prayed to the Supreme Lord for relief from Hiranyaka&#347;ipu's rule.</P><P>Lord Vishnu informed the demigods that they and the other living entities would be saved from the fearful conditions created by Hiranyaka&#347;ipu. Since Hiranyaka&#347;ipu was the oppressor of all the demigods, the followers of the Vedas, the cows, the br&#257;hmanas and the religious, saintly persons, and since he was envious of the Supreme Lord, he would naturally be killed very soon. Hiranyaka&#347;ipu's last exploit would be to torment his own son Prahl&#257;da, who was a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata, an exalted Vaishnava. Then his life would end. When the demigods were thus reassured by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everyone was satisfied, knowing that the miseries inflicted upon them by Hiranyaka&#347;ipu would come to an end.</P><P>Finally, N&#257;rada Muni describes the characteristics of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the son of Hiranyaka&#347;ipu, and describes how his father envied his own qualified son. In this way the chapter ends.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../3/37-38.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
