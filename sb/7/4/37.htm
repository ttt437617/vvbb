Indeed, he gave them up altogether and remained silent and dull, being fully absorbed in Krishna consciousness. Since his mind was always affected by Krishna consciousness, he could not understand how the world goes on being fully absorbed in the activities of sense gratification.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is the vivid example of a great person fully absorbed in Krishna consciousness. In Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/8/274.htm">Madhya 8.274</A>) it is said:</P><P>sth&#257;vara-ja&#324;gama dekhe, n&#257; dekhe t&#257;ra m&#363;rti</P><P CLASS=n>sarvatra haya nija ishta-deva-sph&#363;rti</P><P>A fully Krishna conscious person, although situated in this material world, does not see anything but Krishna, anywhere and everywhere. This is the sign of a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata. The mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata sees Krishna everywhere because of his attitude of pure love for Krishna. As confirmed in the Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/38.htm">5.38</A>):</P><P>prem&#257;ñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena</P><P CLASS=n>santah sadaiva hridayeshu vilokayanti</P><P CLASS=n>yam &#347;y&#257;masundaram acintya-guna-svar&#363;pam</P><P CLASS=n>govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi</P><P>"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of &#346;y&#257;masundara, situated within the heart of the devotee." An exalted devotee, or mah&#257;tm&#257;, who is rarely to be seen, remains fully conscious of Krishna and constantly sees the Lord within the core of his heart. It is sometimes said that when one is influenced by evil stars like Saturn, R&#257;hu or Ketu, he cannot make advancement in any prospective activity. In just the opposite way, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was influenced by Krishna, the supreme planet, and thus he could not think of the material world and live without Krishna consciousness. That is the sign of a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata. Even if one is an enemy of Krishna, a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata sees him to be also engaged in Krishna's service. Another crude example is that everything appears yellow to the jaundiced eye. Similarly, to a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata, everyone but himself appears to be engaged in Krishna's service.</P><P>Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is the approved mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata, the supreme devotee. In the previous verse it was stated that he had natural attachment (naisargik&#299; ratih). The symptoms of such natural attachment for Krishna are described in this verse. Although Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was only a boy, he had no interest in playing. As stated in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../11/2/42.htm">11.2.42</A>), viraktir anyatra ca: the symptom of perfect Krishna consciousness is that one loses interest in all material activities. For a small boy to give up playing is impossible, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, being situated in first-class devotional service, was always absorbed in a trance of Krishna consciousness. Just as a materialistic person is always absorbed in thoughts of material gain, a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata like Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is always absorbed in thoughts of Krishna.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
