That process is the performance of duties by which love for the Supreme Lord develops.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Among the linking processes that elevate one from bondage to material contamination, the one recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be accepted as the best. That process is clearly explained in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, where the Lord says, sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m ekam &#347;aranam vraja: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/66.htm">Bg. 18.66</A>] "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." This process is the best because the Lord assures, aham tv&#257;m sarva-p&#257;pebhyo mokshayishy&#257;mi m&#257; &#347;ucah: "I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear." There is no need to be worried, for the Lord Himself assures that He will care for His devotee and save him from the reactions of sinful activities. Material bondage is a result of sinful activity. Therefore, since the Lord assures that He will dissipate the results of fruitive material activities, there is no need to be worried. This process of understanding one's position as a spirit soul and then engaging oneself in devotional service is therefore the best. The entire Vedic program is based on this principle, and one can understand it as recommended in the Vedas:</P><P>yasya deve par&#257; bhaktir</P><P CLASS=n>yath&#257; deve tath&#257; gurau</P><P CLASS=n>tasyaite kathit&#257; hy arth&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>prak&#257;&#347;ante mah&#257;tmanah</P><P CLASS=n>[<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/su6/23">&#346;U 6.23</A>]</P><P>"Unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed." (&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upanishad <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/6/23">6.23</A>) One must accept the pure devotee, the representative of God, as one's guru and then offer him all the respects one would offer the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the secret of success. For one who adopts this method, the perfect process is revealed. In this verse, the words yair añjas&#257; ratih indicate that by offering service and surrendering to the spiritual master, one is elevated to devotional service, and by performing devotional service one gradually becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of this attachment to the Lord, one can understand the Lord. In other words, one can understand what the Lord's position is, what our position is and what our relationship is. All this can be understood very easily by the simple method of bhakti-yoga. As soon as one is situated on the platform of bhakti-yoga, the root cause of one's suffering and material bondage is destroyed. This is clearly explained in the next verse, which gives the secret of success.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="30-31.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
