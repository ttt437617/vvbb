A mother sometimes cares for her son by combing his hair, massaging his body with oil, or bathing him. Similarly, the wife of the teacher is also a mother (guru-patn&#299;), and therefore she may also care for the disciple in a motherly way. If the wife of the teacher is a young woman, however, a young brahmac&#257;r&#299; should not allow such a mother to touch him. This is strictly prohibited. There are seven kinds of mothers:</P><P>&#257;tma-m&#257;t&#257; guroh patn&#299;</P><P CLASS=n>br&#257;hman&#299; r&#257;ja-patnik&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>dhenur dh&#257;tr&#299; tath&#257; prithv&#299;</P><P CLASS=n>saptait&#257; m&#257;tarah smrit&#257;h</P><P>These mothers are the original mother, the wife of the teacher or spiritual master, the wife of a br&#257;hmana, the king's wife, the cow, the nurse and the earth. Unnecessary association with women, even with one's mother, sister or daughter, is strictly prohibited. This is human civilization. A civilization that allows men to mix unrestrictedly with women is an animal civilization. In Kali-yuga, people are extremely liberal, but mixing with women and talking with them as equals actually constitutes an uncivilized way of life.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
