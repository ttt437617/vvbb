The word dharma here does not refer to some religious faith. As clearly stated, dharmo hy asyopadeshtavyo r&#257;jñ&#257;m yo griha-medhin&#257;m. There are two kinds of royal families &#8212; one whose members are simply attached to household life and the other consisting of r&#257;jarshis, kings who govern with ruling power but are as good as great saints. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja wanted to become a r&#257;jarshi, whereas Hiranyaka&#347;ipu wanted him to become a king attached to sense enjoyment (griha-medhin&#257;m). Therefore in the &#256;ryan system there is varn&#257;&#347;rama-dharma, by which everyone should be educated according to his position in society's division of varna (br&#257;hmana, kshatriya, vai&#347;ya and &#347;&#363;dra) and &#257;&#347;rama (brahmacarya, grihastha, v&#257;naprastha and sanny&#257;sa).</P><P>A devotee purified by devotional service is always in the transcendental position above the mundane qualities. Thus the difference between Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Hiranyaka&#347;ipu was that Hiranyaka&#347;ipu wanted to keep Prahl&#257;da in mundane attachment whereas Prahl&#257;da was above the modes of material nature. As long as one is under the control of material nature, his occupational duty is different from that of a person not under such control. One's real dharma, or occupational duty, is described in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (dharmam tu s&#257;ksh&#257;d bhagavat-pran&#299;tam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../6/3/19.htm">SB 6.3.19</A>]). As described to his order carriers by Dharmar&#257;ja, or Yamar&#257;ja, a living being is a spiritual identity, and therefore his occupational duty is also spiritual. The real dharma is that which is advised in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;: sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m ekam &#347;aranam vraja [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/66.htm">Bg. 18.66</A>]. One must give up one's material occupational duties, just as one must give up his material body. Whatever one's occupational duty, even according to the varn&#257;&#347;rama system, one must give it up and engage in one's spiritual function. One's real dharma, or occupational duty, is explained by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. J&#299;vera 'svar&#363;pa' haya &#8212; krishnera 'nitya-d&#257;sa': [Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/20/108.htm">Madhya 20.108</A>] every living being is an eternal servant of Krishna. That is one's real occupational duty.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
