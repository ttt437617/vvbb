As described in this chapter, Hiranyaka&#347;ipu tried to kill Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, even by having a snake bite him and by putting him under the feet of elephants, yet he was unsuccessful.</P><P>Hiranyaka&#347;ipu's spiritual master, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, had two sons named Shanda and Amarka, to whom Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was entrusted for education. Although the teachers tried to educate the boy Prahl&#257;da in politics, economics and other material activities, he did not care for their instructions. Instead, he continued to be a pure devotee. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja never liked the idea of discriminating between one's friends and enemies. Because he was spiritually inclined, he was equal toward everyone.</P><P>Once upon a time, Hiranyaka&#347;ipu inquired from his son what the best thing was that he had learned from his teachers. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja replied that a man engrossed in the material consciousness of duality, thinking, "This is mine, and that belongs to my enemy," should give up his householder life and go to the forest to worship the Supreme Lord.</P><P>When Hiranyaka&#347;ipu heard from his son about devotional service, he decided that this small boy had been polluted by some friend in school. Thus he advised the teachers to take care of the boy so that he would not become a Krishna conscious devotee. However, when the teachers inquired from Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja why he was going against their teachings, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja taught the teachers that the mentality of ownership is false and that he was therefore trying to become an unalloyed devotee of Lord Vishnu. The teachers, being very angry at this answer, chastised and threatened the boy with many fearful conditions. They taught him to the best of their ability and then brought him before his father.</P><P>Hiranyaka&#347;ipu affectionately took his son Prahl&#257;da on his lap and then inquired from him what the best thing was that he had learned from his teachers. As usual, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja began praising the nine processes of devotional service, such as &#347;ravanam and k&#299;rtanam. Thus the King of the demons, Hiranyaka&#347;ipu, being extremely angry, chastised the teachers, Shanda and Amarka, for having wrongly trained Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. The so-called teachers informed the King that Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was automatically a devotee and did not listen to their instructions. When they proved themselves innocent, Hiranyaka&#347;ipu inquired from Prahl&#257;da where he had learned vishnu-bhakti. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja replied that those who are attached to family life do not develop Krishna consciousness, either personally or collectively. Instead, they suffer repeated birth and death in this material world and continue simply chewing the chewed. Prahl&#257;da explained that the duty of every man is to take shelter of a pure devotee and thus become eligible to understand Krishna consciousness.</P><P>Enraged at this answer, Hiranyaka&#347;ipu threw Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja from his lap. Since Prahl&#257;da was so treacherous that he had become a devotee of Vishnu, who had killed his uncle Hirany&#257;ksha, Hiranyaka&#347;ipu asked his assistants to kill him. The assistants of Hiranyaka&#347;ipu struck Prahl&#257;da with sharp weapons, threw him under the feet of elephants, subjected him to hellish conditions, threw him from the peak of a mountain and tried to kill him in thousands of other ways, but they were unsuccessful. Hiranyaka&#347;ipu therefore became increasingly afraid of his son Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and arrested him. The sons of Hiranyaka&#347;ipu's spiritual master, &#346;ukr&#257;c&#257;rya, began teaching Prahl&#257;da in their own way, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not accept their instructions. While the teachers were absent from the classroom, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja began to preach Krishna consciousness in the school, and by his instructions all his class friends, the sons of the demons, became devotees like him.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../4/46.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
