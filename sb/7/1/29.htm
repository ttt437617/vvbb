Similarly, if the conditioned souls somehow or other think of Krishna, who is sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>], they will become free from their sins. Whether thinking of Him as their worshipable Lord or an enemy, because of constantly thinking of Him they will regain their spiritual bodies.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/10.htm">4.10</A>) the Lord says:</P><P>v&#299;ta-r&#257;ga-bhaya-krodh&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>man-may&#257; m&#257;m up&#257;&#347;rit&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>bahavo jñ&#257;na-tapas&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>p&#363;t&#257; mad-bh&#257;vam &#257;gat&#257;h</P><P>"Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me &#8212; and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me." There are two ways of constantly thinking of Krishna &#8212; as a devotee and as an enemy. A devotee, of course, by his knowledge and tapasya, becomes free from fear and anger and becomes a pure devotee. Similarly, an enemy, although thinking of Krishna inimically, thinks of Him constantly and also becomes purified. This is confirmed elsewhere in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/30.htm">9.30</A>), where the Lord says:</P><P>api cet su-dur&#257;c&#257;ro</P><P CLASS=n>bhajate m&#257;m ananya-bh&#257;k</P><P CLASS=n>s&#257;dhur eva sa mantavyah</P><P CLASS=n>samyag vyavasito hi sah</P><P>"Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he engages in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated." A devotee undoubtedly worships the Lord with rapt attention. Similarly, if an enemy (sudur&#257;c&#257;rah) always thinks of Krishna, he also becomes a purified devotee. The example given here concerns the grassworm that becomes beelike because of constantly thinking of the bee that forces it to enter a hole. By always thinking of the bee in fear, the grassworm starts to become a bee. This is a practical example. Lord Krishna appears within this material world for two purposes &#8212; paritr&#257;n&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;m vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca dushkrit&#257;m: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/8.htm">Bg. 4.8</A>] to protect the devotees and annihilate the demons. The s&#257;dhus and devotees certainly think of the Lord always, but dushkrit&#299;s, the demons like Kamsa and &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, also think of Krishna in terms of killing Him. By thinking of Krishna, both the demons and devotees attain liberation from the clutches of material m&#257;y&#257;.</P><P>This verse uses the word m&#257;y&#257;-manuje. When Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in His original spiritual potency (sambhav&#257;my &#257;tma-m&#257;yay&#257; [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/6.htm">Bg. 4.6</A>]), He is not forced to accept a form made by material nature. Therefore the Lord is addressed as &#299;&#347;vara, the controller of m&#257;y&#257;. He is not controlled by m&#257;y&#257;. When a demon continuously thinks of Krishna because of enmity toward Him, he is certainly freed from the sinful reactions of his life. To think of Krishna in any way, in terms of His name, form, qualities, paraphernalia or anything pertaining to Him, is beneficial for everyone. Srinvat&#257;m sva-kath&#257;h krishnah punya-&#347;ravana-k&#299;rtanah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/2/17.htm">SB 1.2.17</A>]. Thinking of Krishna, hearing the holy name of Krishna or hearing the pastimes of Krishna will make one pure, and then he will become a devotee. Our Krishna consciousness movement is therefore trying to introduce the system of somehow or other letting everyone hear the holy name of Krishna and take Krishna's pras&#257;da. Thus one will gradually become a devotee, and his life will be successful.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
