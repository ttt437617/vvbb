Lord Vishnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the supreme controller, the Supersoul of all living entities. Because He has no material body, He has no false conception of "I and mine." It is therefore incorrect to think that He feels pleasure or pain when blasphemed or offered prayers. This is impossible for Him. Thus He has no enemy and no friend. When He chastises the demons it is for their good, and when He accepts the prayers of the devotees it is for their good. He is affected neither by prayers nor by blasphemy.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Because of being covered by material bodies, the conditioned souls, including even greatly learned scholars and falsely educated professors, all think that as soon as the body is finished, everything is finished. This is due to their bodily conception of life. Krishna has no such bodily conception, nor is His body different from His self. Therefore, since Krishna has no material conception of life, how can He be affected by material prayers and accusations? Krishna's body is described herewith as kaivalya, nondifferent from Himself. Since everyone has a material bodily conception of life, if Krishna had such a conception what would be the difference between Krishna and the conditioned soul? Krishna's instructions in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; are accepted as final because He does not possess a material body. As soon as one has a material body he has four deficiencies, but since Krishna does not possess a material body, He has no deficiencies. He is always spiritually conscious and blissful. &#298;&#347;varah paramah krishnah sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigrahah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>]: His form is eternal, blissful knowledge. Sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigrahah, &#257;nanda-cinmaya-rasa and kaivalya are the same.</P><P>Krishna can expand Himself as Param&#257;tm&#257; in the core of everyone's heart. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/13/3.htm">13.3</A>) this is confirmed. Kshetrajñam c&#257;pi m&#257;m viddhi sama-kshetreshu bh&#257;rata: the Lord is the Param&#257;tm&#257; &#8212; the &#257;tm&#257; or Superself of all individual souls. Therefore it must naturally be concluded that He has no defective bodily conceptions. Although situated in everyone's body, He has no bodily conception of life. He is always free from such conceptions, and thus He cannot be affected by anything in relation to the material body of the j&#299;va.</P><P>Krishna says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/16/19.htm">16.19</A>):</P><P>t&#257;n aham dvishatah kr&#363;r&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>sams&#257;reshu nar&#257;dham&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>kship&#257;my ajasram a&#347;ubh&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>&#257;sur&#299;shv eva yonishu</P><P>"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life." Whenever the Lord punishes persons like demons, however, such punishment is meant for the good of the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul, being envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, may accuse Him, saying, "Krishna is bad, Krishna is a thief" and so on, but Krishna, being kind to all living entities, does not consider such accusations. Instead, He takes account of the conditioned soul's chanting of "Krishna, Krishna" so many times. He sometimes punishes such demons for one life by putting them in a lower species, but then, when they have stopped accusing Him, they are liberated in the next life because of chanting Krishna's name constantly. Blaspheming the Supreme Lord or His devotee is not at all good for the conditioned soul, but Krishna, being very kind, punishes the conditioned soul in one life for such sinful activities and then takes him back home, back to Godhead. The vivid example for this is Vritr&#257;sura, who was formerly Citraketu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, a great devotee. Because he derided Lord &#346;iva, the foremost of all devotees, he had to accept the body of a demon called Vritra, but then he was taken back to Godhead. Thus when Krishna punishes a demon or conditioned soul, He stops that soul's habit of blaspheming Him, and when the soul becomes completely pure, the Lord takes him back to Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
