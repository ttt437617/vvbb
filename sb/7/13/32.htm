Thus they are unable to sleep at night, and they have to take pills for mental tranquillity to invite sleep. And sometimes even the pills are a failure. Consequently the result of having accumulated money by so much labor is certainly not happiness, but only distress. What is the value of acquiring a comfortable position if one's mind is always disturbed? Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura has therefore sung:</P><P>sams&#257;ra-bish&#257;nale, dib&#257;ni&#347;i hiy&#257; jvale,</P><P CLASS=n>jud&#257;ite n&#257; kainu up&#257;ya</P><P>"I am suffering from the poisonous effect of material enjoyment. Thus my heart is always burning and is almost on the verge of failure." The result of the greedy capitalist's unnecessary accumulation of wealth is that he must suffer from a blazing fire of anxiety and always be concerned with how to save his money and invest it properly to get more and more. Such a life is certainly not very happy, but because of the spell of the illusory energy, materialistic persons engage in such activities.</P><P>As far as our Krishna consciousness movement is concerned, we are getting money naturally, by the grace of God, by selling our literature. This literature is not sold for our sense gratification; to spread the Krishna consciousness movement we need so many things, and Krishna is therefore supplying us the requisite money to advance this mission. The mission of Krishna is to spread Krishna consciousness all over the world, and for this purpose we naturally must have sufficient money. Therefore, according to the advice of &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; Prabhup&#257;da, we should not give up attachment to money that can spread the Krishna consciousness movement. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; says in his Bhakti-ras&#257;mrita-sindhu (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/brs1/2/256">1.2.256</A>):</P><P>pr&#257;pañcikatay&#257; buddhy&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>hari-sambandhi-vastunah</P><P CLASS=n>mumukshubhih parity&#257;go</P><P CLASS=n>vairagyam phalgu kathyate</P><P>"When persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things which are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, this is called incomplete renunciation." Money that can help in spreading the Krishna consciousness movement is not a part of the material world, and we should not give it up, thinking that it is material. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; advises:</P><P>an&#257;saktasya vishay&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>yath&#257;rham upayuñjatah</P><P CLASS=n>nirbandhah krishna-sambandhe</P><P CLASS=n>yuktam vair&#257;gyam ucyate</P><P>"When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to Krishna, one is rightly situated above possessiveness." (Bhakti-ras&#257;mrita-sindhu <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/brs1/2/255">1.2.255</A>) Money is undoubtedly coming in great quantities, but we should not be attached to this money for sense gratification; every cent should be spent for spreading the Krishna consciousness movement, not for sense gratification. There is danger for a preacher when he receives great quantities of money, for as soon as he spends even a single cent of the collection for his personal sense gratification, he becomes a fallen victim. The preachers of the Krishna consciousness movement should be extremely careful not to misuse the immense quantities of money needed to spread this movement. Let us not make this money the cause of our distress; it should be used for Krishna, and that will cause our eternal happiness. Money is Lakshm&#299;, or the goddess of fortune, the companion of N&#257;r&#257;yana. Lakshm&#299;j&#299; must always remain with N&#257;r&#257;yana, and then there need be no fear of degradation.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
