Because of fear and obedience, no one could come forward to serve the Lord directly.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>When the Lord sat on the throne of Hiranyaka&#347;ipu, there was no one to protest; no enemy came forward on behalf of Hiranyaka&#347;ipu to fight with the Lord. This means that His supremacy was immediately accepted by the demons. Another point is that although Hiranyaka&#347;ipu treated the Lord as his bitterest enemy, he was the Lord's faithful servant in Vaikuntha, and therefore the Lord had no hesitation in sitting on the throne that Hiranyaka&#347;ipu had so laboriously created. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura remarks in this connection that sometimes, with great care and attention, great saintly persons and rishis offer the Lord valuable seats dedicated with Vedic mantras and tantras, but still the Lord does not sit upon those thrones. Hiranyaka&#347;ipu, however, had formerly been Jaya, the doorkeeper at the Vaikuntha gate, and although he had fallen because of the curse of the br&#257;hmanas and had gotten the nature of a demon, and although he had never offered anything to the Lord as Hiranyaka&#347;ipu, the Lord is so affectionate to His devotee and servant that He nonetheless took pleasure in sitting on the throne that Hiranyaka&#347;ipu had created. In this regard it is to be understood that a devotee is fortunate in any condition of his life.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
