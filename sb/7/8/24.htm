This is not at all astonishing, for the Lord is always situated in pure goodness. Formerly, during creation, He entered the dark universe and illuminated it by His spiritual effulgence.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The Lord is situated transcendentally, in pure goodness. The material world is generally controlled by tamo-guna, the quality of ignorance, but the spiritual world, because of the presence of the Lord and His effulgence, is free from all contamination by darkness, passion or contaminated goodness. Although there is a tinge of goodness in this material world in terms of the brahminical qualifications, such qualifications sometimes become invisible because of the strong prevalence of the modes of passion and ignorance. But because the Lord is always transcendentally situated, the material modes of passion and ignorance cannot touch Him. Whenever the Lord is present, there cannot be any darkness from the mode of ignorance. It is stated in Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/22/31.htm">Madhya 22.31</A>):</P><P>krishna &#8212; s&#363;rya-sama, m&#257;y&#257; haya andhak&#257;ra</P><P CLASS=n>y&#257;h&#257;&#324; krishna, t&#257;h&#257;&#324; n&#257;hi m&#257;y&#257;ra adhik&#257;ra</P><P>"Godhead is light. Nescience is darkness. Where there is Godhead there is no nescience." This material world is full of darkness and ignorance of spiritual life, but by bhakti-yoga this ignorance is dissipated. The Lord appeared because of the bhakti-yoga exhibited by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, and as soon as the Lord appeared, the influence of Hiranyaka&#347;ipu's passion and ignorance was vanquished as the Lord's quality of pure goodness, or the Brahman effulgence, became prominent. In that prominent effulgence, Hiranyaka&#347;ipu became invisible, or his influence became insignificant. An example illustrating how the darkness of the material world is vanquished is given in the &#347;&#257;stra. When Brahm&#257; was created from the lotus stem growing from the abdomen of Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu, Lord Brahm&#257; saw everything to be dark, but when he received knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything became clear, as everything becomes clear when one comes from night to sunshine. The important point is that as long as we are in the material modes of nature, we are always in darkness. This darkness cannot be dissipated without the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is invoked by the practice of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga creates a transcendental situation with no tinges of material contamination.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
