There are also other processes of purification, until the end of life, when the funeral ceremony [antyeshti-kriy&#257;] is performed. Thus in due course a qualified br&#257;hmana becomes uninterested in materialistic activities and sacrifices, but he offers the sensual sacrifices, in full knowledge, into the working senses, which are illuminated by the fire of knowledge.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Those interested in materialistic activities remain in the cycle of birth and death. Pravritti-m&#257;rga, or the inclination to stay in the material world to enjoy varieties of sense gratification, has been explained in the previous verse. Now, in this verse, it is explained that one who has perfect brahminical knowledge rejects the process of elevation to higher planets and accepts nivritti-m&#257;rga; in other words, he prepares himself to go back home, back to Godhead. Those who are not br&#257;hmanas but atheists do not know what is pravritti-m&#257;rga or nivritti-m&#257;rga; they simply want to obtain pleasure at any cost. Our Krishna consciousness movement is therefore training devotees to give up the pravritti-m&#257;rga and accept the nivritti-m&#257;rga in order to return home, back to Godhead. This is a little difficult to understand, but it is very easy if one takes to Krishna consciousness seriously and tries to understand Krishna. A Krishna conscious person can understand that performing yajña according to the karma-k&#257;nda system is a useless waste of time and that merely giving up the karma-k&#257;nda and accepting the process of speculation is also unfruitful. Therefore Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura has sung in his prema-bhakti-candrik&#257;:</P><P>karma-k&#257;nda, jñ&#257;na-k&#257;nda, kevala vishera bh&#257;nda</P><P CLASS=n>'amrita' baliy&#257; yeb&#257; kh&#257;ya</P><P CLASS=n>n&#257;n&#257; yoni sad&#257; phire, kadarya bhakshana kare,</P><P CLASS=n>t&#257;ra janma adhah-p&#257;te y&#257;ya</P><P>A life of karma-k&#257;nda or jñ&#257;na-k&#257;nda is like a poison pot, and one who takes to such a life is doomed. In the karma-k&#257;nda system, one is destined to accept birth and death again and again. Similarly, with jñ&#257;na-k&#257;nda one falls down again to this material world. Only worship of the Supreme Person offers one the safety of going back home, back to Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="50-51.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="53.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
