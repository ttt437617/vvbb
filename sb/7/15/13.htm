Religious principles introduced by others are called para-dharma. A new type of religion created by one who is falsely proud and who opposes the principles of the Vedas is called upadharma. And interpretation by one's jugglery of words is called chala-dharma.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>To create a new type of dharma has become fashionable in this age. So-called sv&#257;m&#299;s and yog&#299;s support that one may follow any type of religious system, according to one's own choice, because all systems are ultimately the same. In &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, however, such fashionable ideas are called vidharma because they go against one's own religious system. The real religious system is described by the Supreme Personality of Godhead: sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m ekam &#347;aranam vraja [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/66.htm">Bg. 18.66</A>]. The real religious system is that of surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord. In the Sixth Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, in connection with Aj&#257;mila's deliverance, Yamar&#257;ja says, dharmam tu s&#257;ksh&#257;d bhagavat-pran&#299;tam: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../6/3/19.htm">SB 6.3.19</A>] real religion is that which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as real law is that which is given by the government. No one can manufacture actual law at home, nor can one manufacture actual religion. Elsewhere it is said, sa vai pums&#257;m paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokshaje: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/2/6.htm">SB 1.2.6</A>] the real religious system is that which leads one to become a devotee of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, anything opposed to this religious system of progressive Krishna consciousness is called vidharma, para-dharma, upadharma or chala-dharma. Misinterpretation of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; is chala-dharma. When Krishna directly says something and some rascal interprets it to mean something different, this is chala-dharma &#8212; a religious system of cheating &#8212; or &#347;abda-bhit, a jugglery of words. One should be extremely careful to avoid these various types of cheating systems of religion.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
