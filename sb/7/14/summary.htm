When Yudhishthira Mah&#257;r&#257;ja became very much inquisitive about the occupational duties for the householder, N&#257;rada Muni advised him that a grihastha's first duty is to be fully dependent on V&#257;sudeva, Krishna, and to try to satisfy Him in all respects by executing one's prescribed devotional service. This devotional service will depend on the instructions of authorities and the association of devotees who are actually engaged in devotional service. The beginning of devotional service is &#347;ravanam, or hearing. One must hear from the mouths of realized souls. In this way the grihastha's attraction to his wife and children will gradually be reduced.</P><P>As for the maintenance of his family, a grihastha, while earning what he requires for his living, must be very conscientious and must not undergo extraordinary endeavor simply to accumulate money and unnecessarily increase in material comforts. Although a grihastha should externally be very active in earning his livelihood, he should internally be situated as a fully self-realized person, without attachment for material gains. His dealings with family members or friends should be performed simply to fulfill their purpose; one should not be extravagantly engaged in this way. Instructions from family members and society should be accepted superficially, but in essence the grihastha should be engaged in occupational duties advised by the spiritual master and &#347;&#257;stra. Specifically a grihastha should engage in agricultural activities to earn money. As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/44.htm">18.44</A>), krishi-go-rakshya-v&#257;nijyam &#8212; agriculture, cow protection and trade &#8212; are special duties of grihasthas. If by chance or by the grace of the Lord more money comes, it should be properly engaged for the Krishna consciousness movement. One should not be eager to earn more money simply for sensual pleasure. A grihastha should always remember that one who is endeavoring to accumulate more money than necessary is to be considered a thief and is punishable by the laws of nature.</P><P>A grihastha should be very much affectionate toward lower animals, birds and bees, treating them exactly like his own children. A grihastha should not indulge in killing animals or birds for sense gratification. He should provide the necessities of life even to the dogs and the lowest creatures and should not exploit others for sense gratification. Factually, according to the instructions of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, every grihastha is a great communist who provides the means of living for everyone. Whatever a grihastha may possess he should equally distribute to all living entities, without discrimination. The best process is to distribute pras&#257;da.</P><P>A grihastha should not be very much attached to his wife; he should engage even his own wife in serving a guest with all attention. Whatever money a grihastha accumulates by the grace of God he should spend in five activities, namely worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, receiving Vaishnavas and saintly persons, distributing pras&#257;da to the general public and to all living entities, offering pras&#257;da to his forefathers, and also offering pras&#257;da to his own self. Grihasthas should always be ready to worship everyone as mentioned above. The grihastha should not eat anything not offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is said in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/3/13.htm">3.13</A>), yajña-&#347;isht&#257;&#347;inah santo mucyante sarva-kilbishaih: "The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food that is offered first for sacrifice." The grihastha should also visit the holy places of pilgrimage mentioned in the pur&#257;nas. In this way he should fully engage in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead for the benefit of his family, his society, his country, and humanity at large.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../13/46.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
