Yet although His Lordship eats the oblations offered in the fire, my dear King, He is still more satisfied when nice food made of grains and ghee is offered to Him through the mouths of qualified br&#257;hmanas.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/3/9.htm">3.9</A>), yajñ&#257;rth&#257;t karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karma-bandhanah: all fruitive activities should be performed for sacrifice, which should be directed toward pleasing Krishna. As stated elsewhere in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/5/29.htm">5.29</A>), bhokt&#257;ram yajña-tapas&#257;m sarva-loka-mahe&#347;varam: He is the Supreme Lord and enjoyer of everything. However, although sacrifice may be offered to please Krishna, He is more pleased when grains and ghee, instead of being offered in the fire, are prepared as pras&#257;da and distributed, first to the br&#257;hmanas and then to others. This system pleases Krishna more than anything else. Furthermore, at the present time there is very little chance to offer sacrifices by pouring oblations of food grains and ghee into the fire. Especially in India, there is practically no ghee; for everything that should be done with ghee, people use a certain type of oil preparation. Oil, however, is never recommended for offering in a sacrificial fire. In Kali-yuga, the available quantity of food grains and ghee is gradually diminishing, and people are embarrassed that they cannot produce sufficient ghee and food grains. Under the circumstances, the &#347;&#257;stras enjoin, yajñaih sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-pr&#257;yair yajanti hi sumedhasah: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../11/5/32.htm">SB 11.5.32</A>] in this age, those who are intellectual offer yajña, or perform sacrifices, through the sa&#324;k&#299;rtana movement. Everyone should join the sa&#324;k&#299;rtana movement, offering to the fire of this movement the oblations of his knowledge and riches. In our sa&#324;k&#299;rtana movement, or Hare Krishna movement, we offer sumptuous pras&#257;da to the Deity and later distribute the same pras&#257;da to the br&#257;hmanas, the Vaishnavas and then to the people in general. Krishna's pras&#257;da is offered to the br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas, and the pras&#257;da of the br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas is offered to the general populace. This kind of sacrifice &#8212; chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra and distribution of pras&#257;da &#8212; is the most perfect and bona fide way of offering sacrifice for the pleasure of Yajña, or Vishnu.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
