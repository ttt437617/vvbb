Indeed, we have fallen into this river and are repeatedly suffering the pains of birth and death and eating horrible things. Now kindly look upon us &#8212; not only upon me but also upon all others who are suffering &#8212; and by Your causeless mercy and compassion, deliver us and maintain us.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, a pure Vaishnava, prays to the Lord not only for himself but for all other suffering living entities. There are two classes of Vaishnavas &#8212; the bhajan&#257;nand&#299;s and goshthy-&#257;nand&#299;s. The bhajan&#257;nand&#299;s worship the Lord only for their own personal benefit, but the goshthy-&#257;nand&#299;s try to elevate all others to Krishna consciousness so that they may be saved. Fools who cannot perceive repeated birth and death and the other miseries of materialistic life cannot be sure of what will happen to them in their next birth. Indeed, these foolish, materially contaminated rascals have manufactured an irresponsible way of life that does not consider the next life. They do not know that according to one's own activities, one receives a body selected from 8,400,000 species. These rascals have been described in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; as dushkritino m&#363;dh&#257;h. Nondevotees, those who are not Krishna conscious, must engage in sinful activities, and therefore they are m&#363;dhas &#8212; fools and rascals. They are such fools that they do not know what will happen to them in their next life. Although they see varieties of living creatures eating abominable things &#8212; pigs eating stool, crocodiles eating all kinds of flesh, and so on &#8212; they do not realize that they themselves, because of their practice of eating all kinds of nonsense in this life, will be destined to eat the most abominable things in their next life. A Vaishnava is always afraid of such an abominable life, and to free himself from such horrible conditions, he engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord. The Lord is compassionate to them, and therefore He appears for their benefit.</P><P>yad&#257; yad&#257; hi dharmasya</P><P CLASS=n>gl&#257;nir bhavati bh&#257;rata</P><P CLASS=n>abhyutth&#257;nam adharmasya</P><P CLASS=n>tad&#257;tm&#257;nam srij&#257;my aham</P><P>"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bh&#257;rata, and a predominant rise of irreligion &#8212; at that time I descend Myself." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/7.htm">Bg. 4.7</A>) The Lord is always ready to help the fallen souls, but because they are fools and rascals, they do not take to Krishna consciousness and abide by the instructions of Krishna. Therefore although &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is personally the Supreme Lord, Krishna, He comes as a devotee to preach the Krishna consciousness movement. Y&#257;re dekha, t&#257;re kaha 'krishna'-upade&#347;a. One must therefore become a sincere servant of Krishna. &#256;m&#257;ra &#257;jñ&#257;ya guru hañ&#257; t&#257;ra' ei de&#347;a (Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/7/128.htm">Madhya 7.128</A>). One should become a guru and spread Krishna consciousness all over the world, simply by preaching the teachings of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
