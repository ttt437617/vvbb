Thus the mind entraps the living entity in unlimited varieties of desires to be fulfilled by the Vedic directions of karma-k&#257;nda [fruitive activity] and the sixteen elements. Who can get free from this entanglement unless he takes shelter at Your lotus feet?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>If the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present in everything, where is the question of being liberated from material encagement to spiritual, blissful life? Indeed, it is a fact that Krishna is the source of everything, as we understand from Krishna Himself in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (aham sarvasya prabhavah). All the activities in both the spiritual and material world are certainly conducted by the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the agency of either the material or spiritual nature. As further confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/10.htm">9.10</A>), may&#257;dhyakshena prakritih s&#363;yate sacar&#257;caram: without the direction of the Supreme Lord, material nature cannot do anything; it cannot act independently. Therefore, in the beginning the living entity wanted to enjoy the material energy, and to give the living entity all facility, Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, created this material world and gave the living entity the facility to concoct different ideas and plans through the mind. These facilities offered by the Lord to the living entity constitute the sixteen kinds of perverted support in terms of the knowledge-gathering senses, the working senses, the mind and the five material elements. The wheel of repeated birth and death is created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but to direct the bewildered living entity in progress toward liberation according to varied stages of advancement, different directions are given in the Vedas (chandomayam). If one wants to be elevated to the higher planetary systems, he may follow the Vedic directions. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/25.htm">9.25</A>):</P><P>y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>pitrin y&#257;nti pitri-vrat&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>bh&#363;t&#257;ni y&#257;nti bh&#363;tejy&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>y&#257;nti mad-y&#257;jino 'pi m&#257;m</P><P>"Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with Me." The real purpose of the Vedas is to direct one back home, back to Godhead, but the living entity, not knowing the real goal of his life, wants to go sometimes here and sometimes there and do sometimes this and sometimes that. In this way he wanders throughout the entire universe, imprisoned in various species and thus engaging in various activities for which he must suffer the reactions. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore says:</P><P>brahm&#257;nda bhramite kona bh&#257;gyav&#257;n j&#299;va</P><P CLASS=n>guru-krishna-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja</P><P>(Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/19/151.htm">Madhya 19.151</A>)</P><P>The fallen, conditioned living entity, trapped by the external energy, loiters in the material world, but if by good fortune he meets a bona fide representative of the Lord who gives him the seed of devotional service, and if he takes advantage of such a guru, or representative of God, he receives the bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja, the seed of devotional service. If he properly cultivates Krishna consciousness, he is then gradually elevated to the spiritual world. The ultimate conclusion is that one must surrender to the principles of bhakti-yoga, for then one will gradually attain liberation. No other method of liberation from the material struggle is at all possible.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
