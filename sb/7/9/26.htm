And what is to be said of Your causeless mercy, which was never offered even to Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva or the goddess of fortune, Lakshm&#299;? You never put Your lotus hand upon their heads, but You have put it upon mine.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was surprised at the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, for although Prahl&#257;da was born in a demoniac family and although the Lord had never before placed His lotus hand on the head of Brahm&#257;, &#346;iva or the goddess of fortune, His constant companion, Lord Nrisimhadeva kindly placed His hand on the head of Prahl&#257;da. This is the meaning of causeless mercy. The causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead may be bestowed upon anyone, regardless of his position in this material world. Everyone is eligible to worship the Supreme Lord, irrespective of his material position. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/14/26.htm">14.26</A>):</P><P>m&#257;m ca yo 'vyabhic&#257;rena</P><P CLASS=n>bhakti yogena sevate</P><P CLASS=n>sa gun&#257;n samat&#299;tyait&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>brahma-bh&#363;y&#257;ya kalpate</P><P>"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." Anyone who engages in continuous devotional service to the Lord is situated in the spiritual world and has nothing to do with the material qualities (sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna).</P><P>Because Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was situated on the spiritual platform, he had nothing to do with his body, which had been born of the modes of passion and ignorance. The symptoms of passion and ignorance are described in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/2/19.htm">1.2.19</A>) as lust and hankering (tad&#257; rajas tamo-bh&#257;v&#257;h k&#257;ma-lobh&#257;daya&#347; ca ye). Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, being a great devotee, thought the body born of his father to be born of passion and ignorance, but because Prahl&#257;da was fully engaged in the service of the Lord, his body did not belong to the material world. The pure Vaishnava's body is spiritualized even in this life. For example, when iron is put into a fire it becomes red-hot and is no longer iron but fire. Similarly, the so-called material bodies of devotees who fully engage in the devotional service of the Lord, being constantly in the fire of spiritual life, have nothing to do with matter, but are spiritualized.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya remarks that the goddess of fortune, the mother of the universe, could not get mercy similar to that which was offered to Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, for although the goddess of fortune is always a constant companion of the Supreme Lord, the Lord is more inclined to His devotees. In other words, devotional service is so great that when it is offered even by those born in low families, the Lord accepts it as being more valuable than the service offered by the goddess of fortune. Lord Brahm&#257;, King Indra and the other demigods living in the upper planetary systems are situated in a different spirit of consciousness, and therefore they are sometimes troubled by demons, but a devotee, even if situated in the lower planets, enjoys life in Krishna consciousness under any circumstances. paratah svatah karmatah: as he acts himself, as he is instructed by others or as he performs his material activities, he enjoys life in every respect. In this regard, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya quotes the following verses, which are mentioned in the Brahma-tarka:</P><P>&#347;r&#299;-brahma-br&#257;hm&#299;v&#299;ndr&#257;di-</P><P CLASS=n>tri-katat str&#299;-puru-shtut&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>tad anye ca kram&#257;deva</P><P CLASS=n>sad&#257; muktau smrit&#257;v api</P><P CLASS=n>hari-bhaktau ca taj-jñ&#257;ne</P><P CLASS=n>sukhe ca niyamena tu</P><P CLASS=n>paratah svatah karmato v&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>na kathañcit tad anyath&#257;</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
