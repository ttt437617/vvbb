Grihamedhis, so-called grihasthas who have no spiritual knowledge, think that this itching is the greatest platform of happiness, although actually it is a source of distress. The kripanas, the fools who are just the opposite of br&#257;hmanas, are not satisfied by repeated sensuous enjoyment. Those who are dh&#299;ra, however, who are sober and who tolerate this itching, are not subjected to the sufferings of fools and rascals.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Materialists think that sexual indulgence is the greatest happiness in this material world, and therefore they make elaborate plans to satisfy their senses, especially the genitals. This is generally found everywhere, and specifically found in the Western world, where there are regular arrangements to satisfy sex life in different ways. Actually, however, this has not made anyone happy. Even the hippies, who have given up all the materialistic comforts of their fathers and grandfathers, cannot give up the sensational happiness of sex life. Such persons are described here as kripanas, misers. The human form of life is a great asset, for in this life one can fulfill the goal of existence. Unfortunately, however, because of a lack of education and culture, people are victimized by the false happiness of sex life. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore advises one not to be misled by this civilization of sense gratification, and especially not by sex life. Rather, one should be sober, avoid sense gratification and be Krishna conscious. The lusty person, who is compared to a foolish miser, never gets happiness by sense gratification. The influence of material nature is very difficult to surpass, but as stated by Krishna in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/14.htm">7.14</A>), m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante, m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;m taranti te: if one voluntarily submits to the lotus feet of Krishna, he can be saved very easily.</P><P>In reference to the low-grade happiness of sex life, Y&#257;mun&#257;c&#257;rya says in this connection:</P><P>yad&#257;vadhi mama cetah krishna-pad&#257;ravinde</P><P CLASS=n>nava-nava-rasa-dh&#257;manudyata rantum &#257;s&#299;t</P><P CLASS=n>tad&#257;vadhi bata n&#257;r&#299;-sa&#324;game smaryam&#257;ne</P><P CLASS=n>bhavati mukha-vik&#257;rah sushtu nishth&#299;vanam ca</P><P>"Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krishna, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste." Y&#257;mun&#257;c&#257;rya had formerly been a great king who enjoyed sexual happiness in various ways, but since he later engaged himself in the service of the Lord, he enjoyed spiritual bliss and hated to think of sex life. If sexual thoughts came to him, he would spit with disgust.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
