Everyone &#8212; from the greatest personality, Lord Brahm&#257;, down to the small ant &#8212; works under the influence of these modes. Therefore everyone in this material world is influenced by Your energy. The cause for which they work, the place where they work, the time when they work, the matter due to which they work, the goal of life they have considered final, and the process for obtaining this goal &#8212; all are nothing but manifestations of Your energy. Indeed, since the energy and energetic are identical, all of them are but manifestations of You.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Whether one thinks himself protected by his parents, by the government, by some place or by some other cause, everything is due to the various potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everything that is done, whether in the higher, middle or lower planetary systems, is due to the supervision or control of the Supreme Lord. It is therefore said, karman&#257;-daiva-netrena jantur dehopapattaye [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../3/31/1.htm">SB 3.31.1</A>]. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul within the core of everyone's heart, gives inspirations for action according to one's mentality. All of these mentalities are merely facilities given by Krishna to the person acting. Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; therefore says, mattah smritir jñ&#257;nam apohanam ca: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">Bg. 15.15</A>] everyone works according to the inspiration given by the Supersoul. Because everyone has a different goal of life, everyone acts differently, as guided by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P>The words yasmin yato yarhi yena ca yasya yasm&#257;t indicate that all activities, whatever they may be, are but different features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All of them are created by the living entity and fulfilled by the mercy of the Lord. Although all such activities are nondifferent from the Lord, the Lord nonetheless directs, sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m ekam &#347;aranam vraja: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/66.htm">Bg. 18.66</A>] "Give up all other duties and surrender unto Me." When we accept this direction from the Lord, we can actually become happy. As long as we work according to our material senses we are in material life, but as soon as we act according to the real, transcendental direction of the Lord, our position is spiritual. The activities of bhakti, devotional service, are directly under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The N&#257;rada-pañcar&#257;tra states:</P><P>sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmuktam</P><P CLASS=n>tat-paratvena nirmalam</P><P CLASS=n>hrish&#299;kena hrish&#299;ke&#347;a-</P><P CLASS=n>sevanam bhaktir ucyate</P><P CLASS=n>[Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/19/170.htm">Madhya 19.170</A>]</P><P>When one gives up materially designated positions and works directly under the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one's spiritual life is revived. This is described as svar&#363;pena avasthiti, being situated in one's original constitutional position. This is the real description of mukti, or liberation from material bondage.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
