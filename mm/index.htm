Please let me become a constant reciter of Your names, addressing You as &#346;r&#299;-vallabha ["He who is very dear to Lakshm&#299;"], Varada ["the bestower of benedictions"], Day&#257;para ["He who is causelessly merciful"], Bhakta-priya ["He who is very dear to His devotees"], Bhava-lunthana-kovida ["He who is expert at plundering the status quo of repeated birth and death"], N&#257;tha ["the Supreme Lord"], Jagan-niv&#257;sa ["the resort of the cosmos"], and N&#257;ga-&#347;ayana ["the Lord who lies down on the serpent bed"].</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>MM 2</B></A>: All glories to this Personality of Godhead known as the son of &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Devak&#299; dev&#299;! All glories to Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna, the brilliant light of the Vrishni dynasty! All glories to the Personality of Godhead, the hue of whose soft body resembles the blackish color of a new cloud! All glories to Lord Mukunda, who removes the burdens of the earth!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>MM 3</B></A>: O Lord Mukunda! I bow down my head to Your Lordship and respectfully ask You to fulfill this one desire of mine: that in each of my future births I will, by Your Lordship's mercy, always remember and never forget Your lotus feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>MM 4</B></A>: O Lord Hari, it is not to be saved from the dualities of material existence or the grim tribulations of the Kumbh&#299;p&#257;ka hell that I pray to Your lotus feet. Nor is my purpose to enjoy the soft-skinned beautiful women who reside in the gardens of heaven. I pray to Your lotus feet only so that I may remember You alone in the core of my heart, birth after birth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>MM 5</B></A>: O my Lord! I have no attachment for religiosity, or for accumulating wealth, or for enjoying sense gratification. Let these come as they inevitably must, in accordance with my past deeds. But I do pray for this most cherished boon: birth after birth, let me render unflinching devotional service unto Your two lotus feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>MM 6</B></A>: O Lord, killer of the demon Naraka! Let me reside either in the realm of the demigods, in the world of human beings, or in hell, as You please. I pray only that at the point of death I may remember Your two lotus feet, whose beauty defies that of the lotus growing in the &#346;arat season.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>MM 7</B></A>: I always think of Lord Hari, whose joyful lotus face bears a gentle smile. Although He is the son of the cowherd Nanda, He is also the Supreme Absolute Truth worshiped by great sages like N&#257;rada.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>MM 8</B></A>: The desert of material existence has exhausted me. But today I will cast aside all troubles by diving into the lake of Lord Hari and drinking freely of the abundant waters of His splendor. The lotuses in that lake are His hands and feet, and the fish are His brilliant shining eyes. That lake's water relieves all fatigue and is agitated by the waves His arms create. Its current flows deep beyond fathoming.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>MM 9</B></A>: O mind, please never stop taking pleasure in thinking of the Mura demon's destroyer, who has lotus eyes and bears the conch and disc weapon. Indeed, I know of nothing else that gives such extreme pleasure as meditating on Lord Hari's divine feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>MM 10</B></A>: O foolish mind, stop your fearful fretting about the extensive torments imposed by Yamar&#257;ja. How can your enemies, the sinful reactions you have accrued, even touch you? After all, is your master not the Supreme Lord, the husband of Goddess &#346;r&#299;? Cast aside all hesitation and concentrate your thoughts on Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana, whom one very easily attains through devotional service. What can that dispeller of the whole world's troubles not do for His own servant?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>MM 11</B></A>: The people in this vast ocean of birth and death are being blown about by the winds of material dualities. As they flounder in the perilous waters of sense indulgence, with no boat to help them, they are sorely distressed by the need to protect their sons, daughters, and wives. Only the boat that is Lord Vishnu can save them.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>MM 12</B></A>: Dear mind, do not bewilder yourself by anxiously thinking, How can I cross this fathomless and impassable ocean of material existence? There is one who can save you &#8212; Devotion. If you offer her to the lotus-eyed Lord, the killer of Narak&#257;sura, she will carry you across this ocean without fail.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>MM 13</B></A>: O Lord of the three worlds, we are drowning in the vast ocean of sams&#257;ra, which is filled with the waters of material hankering, with many waves of illusion whipped up by the winds of lust, with whirlpools of wives, and with vast schools of sharks and other sea monsters who are our sons and brothers. O giver of all benedictions, please grant me a place on the boat of devotion that is Your lotus feet.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>MM 14</B></A>: Once our savior has been seen, the whole earth becomes no greater than a speck of dust, all the waters of the ocean become mere droplets, the totality of fire becomes a minute spark, the winds become just a faint sigh, and the expanse of space becomes a tiny hole. Great lords like Rudra and Grandfather Brahm&#257; become insignificant, and all the demigods become like small insects. Indeed, even one particle of dust from our Lord's feet conquers all.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>MM 15</B></A>: O people, please hear of this treatment for the disease of birth and death! It is the name of Krishna. Recommended by Y&#257;jñavalkya and other expert yog&#299;s steeped in wisdom, this boundless, eternal inner light is the best medicine, for when drunk it bestows complete and final liberation. Just drink it!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>MM 16</B></A>: O mortal beings, you have submerged yourselves fully in the ocean of material existence, which is filled with the waves of misfortune. Please hear as I briefly tell you how to attain your supreme benefit. Just put aside your various attempts at gaining knowledge and instead begin constantly chanting the mantra om namo n&#257;r&#257;yan&#257;ya and bowing down to the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>MM 17</B></A>: Our master, the Personality of Godhead N&#257;r&#257;yana, who alone rules the three worlds, whom one can serve in meditation, and who happily shares His personal domain, is manifest before us. Yet still we beg for the service of some minor lord of a few villages, some lowly man who can only meagerly reward us. Alas, what foolish wretches we are!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>MM 18</B></A>: O lotus-eyed Lord, please sustain our lives as we constantly relish the nectar of meditating on Your lotus feet, with our palms prayerfully joined, our heads bowed down, our bodily hair standing up in jubilation, our voices choked with emotion, and our eyes flowing with tears.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>MM 19</B></A>: That head is the loftiest which is white with dust from bowing down to Lord Krishna. Those eyes are the most beautiful which darkness has abandoned after they have seen Lord Hari. That intelligence is spotless &#8212; like the white glow of the moon or a conchshell &#8212; which concentrates on Lord M&#257;dhava. And that tongue rains down nectar which constantly glorifies Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>MM 20</B></A>: O tongue, praise the glories of Lord Ke&#347;ava. O mind, worship the enemy of Mura. O hands, serve the Lord of &#346;r&#299;. O ears, hear the topics of Lord Acyuta. O eyes, gaze upon &#346;r&#299; Krishna. O feet, go to the temple of Lord Hari. O nose, smell the tulas&#299; buds on Lord Mukunda's feet. O head, bow down to Lord Adhokshaja.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>MM 21</B></A>: All glories to Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana! Without remembrance of His lotus feet, recitation of scripture is merely crying in the wilderness, regular observance of severe vows enjoined in the Vedas is no more than a way to lose weight, execution of prescribed pious duties is like pouring oblations onto ashes, and bathing at various holy sites is no better than an elephant's bath.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>MM 22</B></A>: O Cupid, abandon your residence in my mind, which is now the home of Lord Mukunda's lotus feet. You have already been incinerated by Lord &#346;iva's fiery glance, so why have you forgotten the power of Lord Mur&#257;ri's disc?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>MM 23</B></A>: Think only of your master and sustainer, the Supreme Lord, who is known as N&#257;r&#257;yana and M&#257;dhava and who lies on the body of the serpent Ananta. He is the darling son of Devak&#299;, the hero of the demigods, and the Lord of the cows, and He holds a conchshell and the bow &#346;&#257;r&#324;ga. He is the husband of the goddess of fortune and the controller of all the universes, which He manifests from His abdomen as a pastime. What will you gain by thinking of anything else?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>MM 24</B></A>: O M&#257;dhava, please do not let me even glance at those whose pious credits are so depleted that they have no devotion for Your lotus feet. Please do not let me be distracted from listening to the worthy narrations of Your pastimes and become interested in other topics. Please, O Lord of the universe, let me pay no attention to those who avoid thinking of You. And let me never be unable to serve You in some menial way, birth after birth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm"><B>MM 25</B></A>: O enemy of Madhu and Kaitabha, O Lord of the universe, the perfection of my life and the most cherished mercy You could show me would be for You to consider me the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of Your servant.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>MM 26</B></A>: My dear tongue, I stand before you with joined palms and beg you to recite the names of Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana. These names describing the Supreme Absolute Truth bring great pleasure, as if exuding honey.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>MM 27</B></A>: At every moment I bow down to the lotus feet of N&#257;r&#257;yana, I perform worship to N&#257;r&#257;yana, I recite the pure name of N&#257;r&#257;yana, and I reflect on the infallible truth of N&#257;r&#257;yana.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28-29.htm"><B>MM 28-29</B></A>: O &#346;r&#299;n&#257;tha, N&#257;r&#257;yana, V&#257;sudeva, divine Krishna, O kind friend of Your devotees! O Cakrap&#257;ni, Padman&#257;bha, Acyuta, Kaitabh&#257;ri, R&#257;ma, Padm&#257;ksha, Hari, Mur&#257;ri! O Ananta, Vaikuntha, Mukunda, Krishna, Govinda, D&#257;modara, M&#257;dhava! Although all people can address You, still they remain silent. Just see how eager they are for their own peril!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>MM 30</B></A>: He is the jewel riding on the back of Garuda, who carries away the Lord's devotees on his wings. He is the magic jewel protecting the three worlds, the jewellike cloud attracting the c&#257;taka-bird eyes of the gop&#299;s, and the jewel among all who gesture gracefully. He is the only jeweled ornament on the ample breasts of Queen Rukmin&#299;, who is herself the jewel of beloved consorts. May that crown jewel of all gods, the best of the cowherds, grant us the supreme benediction.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>MM 31</B></A>: O tongue, please constantly chant the mantra composed of &#346;r&#299; Krishna's names. This is the only mantra for destroying all enemies, the mantra worshiped by every word of the Upanishads, the mantra that uproots sams&#257;ra, the mantra that drives away all the darkness of ignorance, the mantra for attaining infinite opulence, the mantra for curing those bitten by the poisonous snake of worldly distress, and the mantra for making one's birth in this world successful.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>MM 32</B></A>: O mind, please drink the transcendental medicine of &#346;r&#299; Krishna's glories. It is the perfect medicine for curing the disease of bewilderment, for inspiring sages to engage their minds in meditation, and for tormenting the mighty Daitya demons. It alone is the medicine for restoring the three worlds to life and for bestowing unlimited blessings on the Supreme Lord's devotees. Indeed, it is the only medicine that can destroy one's fear of material existence and lead one to the attainment of the supreme good.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>MM 33</B></A>: O Lord Krishna, at this moment let the royal swan of my mind enter the tangled stems of the lotus of Your feet. How will it be possible for me to remember You at the time of death, when my throat will be choked up with mucus, bile, and air?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>MM 34</B></A>: O mind, think of the lotus-eyed Lord who reclines on the mountainlike serpent Ananta. O tongue, glorify Him. O head, bow down to Him. O hands, join your palms in supplication to Him. O body, offer outstretched obeisances to Him. O heart, take full shelter of Him. That Supreme Lord is the topmost Deity. It is He alone who is all-auspicious and supremely purifying, He alone who awards eternal perfection.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm"><B>MM 35</B></A>: One who hears descriptions of Lord Jan&#257;rdana's pastimes and glorious qualities but whose bodily hair fails to bristle in ecstasy and whose eyes fail to flood with tears of pure love &#8212; such a person is indeed the most degraded rascal. What a condemned life he leads!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>MM 36</B></A>: O Lord, the powerful thieves of my senses have blinded me by stealing my most precious possession, my discrimination, and they have thrown me deep into the pitch-dark well of delusion. Please, O Lord of lords, extend Your hand and save this wretched soul.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>MM 37</B></A>: This body's beauty is fleeting, and at last the body must succumb to death after its hundreds of joints have stiffened with old age. So why, bewildered fool, are you asking for medication? Just take the Krishna elixir, the one cure that never fails.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm"><B>MM 38</B></A>: The greatest wonder in human society is this: People are so incorrigible that they reject the life-giving nectar of Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana's names and instead drink poison by speaking everything else.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm"><B>MM 39</B></A>: Let my relatives all abandon me and my superiors condemn me. Still, the supremely blissful Govinda remains my life and soul.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm"><B>MM 40</B></A>: O mankind, with arms raised high I declare the truth! Any mortal who chants the names Mukunda, Nrisimha, and Jan&#257;rdana day after day, even in battle or when facing death, will come to regard his most cherished ambitions as no more valuable than a stone or a block of wood.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm"><B>MM 41</B></A>: Raising my arms, I utter this compassionate advice as loudly as I can: If those in the renounced order want to be delivered from the terrible, poisonous condition of material life, they should have the good sense to constantly hear the mantra om namo n&#257;r&#257;yan&#257;ya.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm"><B>MM 42</B></A>: My mind cannot turn from &#346;r&#299; Krishna's lotus feet, even for a moment. So let my dear ones and other relatives criticize me, my superiors accept or reject me as they like, the common people spread evil gossip about me, and my family's reputation be sullied. For a madman like me, it is honor enough to feel this flood of love of Godhead, which brings such sweet emotions of attraction for my Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm"><B>MM 43</B></A>: May Krishna, the spiritual master of the three worlds, protect us. Continually bow down to Krishna. Krishna has killed all our enemies. Obeisances to Krishna. From Krishna alone this world has come into being. I am the servant of Krishna. This entire universe rests within Krishna. O Krishna, please protect me!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm"><B>MM 44</B></A>: O young cowherd boy! O ocean of mercy! O husband of Lakshm&#299;, the ocean's daughter! O killer of Kamsa! O merciful benefactor of Gajendra! O M&#257;dhava! O younger brother of R&#257;ma! O spiritual master of the three worlds! O lotus-eyed Lord of the gop&#299;s! I know no one greater than You. Please protect me.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm"><B>MM 45</B></A>: Your wife is the beautiful daughter of the ocean, and Your son is Lord Brahm&#257;. The Vedas are Your panegyrist, the demigods comprise Your company of servants, and liberation is Your benediction, while this entire universe is a display of Your magic power. &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; Devak&#299; is Your mother, and Arjuna, the son Indra, is Your friend. For these reasons I have no interest in anyone but You.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm"><B>MM 46</B></A>: The wise inhabitants of the heavenly regions know that the perfection of the head is to offer prostrate obeisances to the Supreme Lord, the perfection of the life-breath is to worship the Lord, the perfection of the mind is to ponder the details of His transcendental qualities, and the perfection of speech is to chant the glories of His qualities.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm"><B>MM 47</B></A>: What person, even if most sinful, has ever said aloud the blessed name N&#257;r&#257;yana and failed to fulfill his desires? But we, alas, never used our power of speech in that way, and so we had to suffer such miseries as living in a womb.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm"><B>MM 48</B></A>: The unlimited and infallible Vishnu, who is always present within the lotus of the heart, grants fearlessness to those who fix their intelligence upon Him. The devotees who meditate on Him will reach the supreme perfection of the Vaishnavas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm"><B>MM 49</B></A>: O Supreme Lord, O Vishnu, You are the most compassionate. So now please show me Your favor and bestow Your mercy upon this helpless soul. O unlimited Lord, kindly uplift this wretch who is drowning in the ocean of material existence. O Lord Hari, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm"><B>MM 50</B></A>: Obeisances to Lord M&#257;dhava, enemy of the Madhu demon. His beautiful form, lying on the couch of the serpent Ananta, is speckled by the shower of spray from the milk ocean's waves.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm"><B>MM 51</B></A>: By themselves the words "Krishna, Krishna" are sufficient to drive away the sins of all living beings. Anyone who possesses devotion for Lord Mukunda that is densely imbued with ecstasy holds in the palms of his hands the gifts of liberation, worldly influence, and wealth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm"><B>MM 52</B></A>: This work was composed by King Kula&#347;ekhara, a bee at the lotus feet of the lotus-eyed Lord. The king's two beloved friends are the twin stems of the exquisite lotus of the br&#257;hmana community, expert Vedic scholars renowned as leaders of the community of poets.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="53.htm"><B>MM 53</B></A>: Who among those who recite this Mukunda-m&#257;l&#257; will not achieve complete happiness? An embodied being who chants these prayers will have all his sinful reactions eradicated and proceed straight to the supreme abode of Lord Vishnu.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=376"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
