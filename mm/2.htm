All glories to Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna, the brilliant light of the Vrishni dynasty! All glories to the Personality of Godhead, the hue of whose soft body resembles the blackish color of a new cloud! All glories to Lord Mukunda, who removes the burdens of the earth!</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The theme of this verse is that the Supreme Truth is the Supreme Person. That the Lord's bodily texture and color are described indicates that He is a person, for the impersonal Brahman cannot have a body that is as soft as anything or whose hue is visualized. The Personality of Godhead appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devak&#299; because for a very long time they performed severe austerities to have the Supreme Lord as their son. Satisfied by their penance and determination, the Lord agreed to become their son.</P><P>From the description of the Lord's birth in the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, we learn that the Lord appeared before Vasudeva and Devak&#299; as N&#257;r&#257;yana, with four hands. But when they prayed to Him to conceal His divinity, the Lord became a small baby with two hands. In the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/4/9.htm">4.9</A>) the Lord promises that one who simply understands the mysteries of His transcendental birth and deeds will be liberated from the clutches of M&#257;y&#257; and go back to Godhead. Therefore there is a gulf of difference between the birth of Krishna and that of an ordinary child.</P><P>One may ask, Since the Supreme Lord is the original father of all living entities, how could a lady known as Devak&#299; give birth to Him as her son? The answer is that Devak&#299; no more gave birth to the Lord than the eastern horizon gives birth to the sun. The sun rises on the eastern horizon and sets below the western horizon, but actually the sun neither rises nor sets. The sun is always in its fixed position in the sky, but the earth is revolving, and due to the different positions of the revolving earth, the sun appears to be rising or setting. In the same way, the Lord always exists, but for His pastimes as a human being He seems to take birth like an ordinary child.</P><P>In His impersonal feature (Brahman) the Supreme Lord is everywhere, inside and outside: as the Supersoul (Param&#257;tm&#257;) He is inside everything, from the gigantic universal form down to the atoms and electrons; and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Bhagav&#257;n) He sustains everything with His energies. (We have already described this feature of the Lord in the purport to the previous verse, in connection with the name Jagan-niv&#257;sa.) Therefore in each of His three features &#8212; Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257;, and Bhagav&#257;n &#8212; the Lord is present everywhere in the material world. Yet He remains aloof, busy with His transcendental pastimes in His supreme abode.</P><P>Those with a poor fund of knowledge cannot accept the idea that the Lord appears in person on the face of the earth. Because they are not conversant with the intricacies of the Lord's transcendental position, whenever such people hear about the appearance of the Lord, they take Him to be either a superhuman being born with a material body or a historical personality worshiped as God under the influence of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. But the Lord is not the plaything of such fools. He is what He is and does not agree to be a subject of their speculations, which perpetually lead them to conclude that His impersonal feature is supreme. The supreme feature of the Absolute Truth is personal &#8212; the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal Brahman is His effulgence, like the light diffused by a powerful fire. The fire burns in one place but diffuses its warmth and light all round, thus exhibiting its different energies. Similarly, by means of His variegated energies the Supreme Lord expands Himself in many ways.</P><P>Persons with a poor fund of knowledge are captivated by one part of His energy and therefore fail to penetrate into the original source of the energy. Whatever astounding energies we see manifest in this world, including atomic and nuclear energies, are all part and parcel of His material, or external, energy. Superior to this material energy, however, is the Lord's marginal energy, exhibited as the living being. Besides these energies, the Supreme Lord has another energy, which is known as the internal energy. The marginal energy can take shelter of either the internal energy or the external energy, but factually it belongs to the Lord's internal energy. The living beings are therefore infinitesimal samples of the Supreme Lord. Qualitatively the living being and the Supreme Lord are equal, but quantitatively they are different, for the Lord is unlimitedly potent whereas the living entities, being infinitesimal by nature, have limited potency.</P><P>Although the Lord is full with all energies and is thus self-sufficient, He enjoys transcendental pleasure by subordinating Himself to His unalloyed devotees. Some great devotees of the Lord cannot surpass the boundary of awe and veneration. But other devotees are in such an intense compact of love with the Lord that they forget His exalted position and regard themselves as His equals or even His superiors. These eternal associates of the Lord relate with Him in the higher statuses of friendship, parenthood, and consorthood. Devotees in a transcendental parental relationship with the Lord think of Him as their dependent child. They forget His exalted position and think that unless they properly feed Him He will fall victim to undernourishment and His health will deteriorate. Devotees in a conjugal relationship with the Lord rebuke Him to correct His behavior, and the Lord enjoys those rebukes more than the prayers of the Vedas. Ordinary devotees bound up by the formalities of Vedic rites cannot enter deep into such confidential loving service to the Lord, and thus their realization remains imperfect. Sometimes they even fall victim to the calamity of impersonalism.</P><P>Vasudeva and Devak&#299; are confidential devotees of the Lord in the mood of parental love. Even greater than them are Nanda and Ya&#347;od&#257;, His foster parents in Vrind&#257;vana. The Lord takes great pleasure in being addressed as Devak&#299;-nandana ("the son of Devak&#299;"), Nanda-nandana ("the son of Nanda"), Ya&#347;od&#257;-nandana ("the son of Ya&#347;od&#257;"), Da&#347;arath&#299; ("the son of King Da&#347;aratha"), Janak&#299;-n&#257;tha ("the husband of Janak&#299;"), and so on. The pleasure one gives the Lord by addressing Him by such names is many, many times greater than the pleasure He enjoys when He is addressed as the Supreme Father, the Greatest of the Great, Parame&#347;vara, or anything of that nature, which indicate volumes of awe and veneration. Therefore the names King Kula&#347;ekhara uses to glorify the Lord in this verse indicate his intimate transcendental relationship with the Lord.</P><P>As explained above, all the names of the Lord are as powerful as the Lord Himself, but one can experience different transcendental mellows by chanting His different transcendental names. For example, the &#347;&#257;stra (scripture) states that there are one thousand principal names of Lord Vishnu, the Personality of Godhead. But if a person utters the name R&#257;ma only once, he gets the result of chanting one thousand names of Vishnu. And if somebody once chants the name Krishna, he achieves the results obtained by chanting the name R&#257;ma three times. In other words, uttering the name Krishna once is equal to uttering three thousand other names of Vishnu.</P><P>Therefore King Kula&#347;ekhara, knowing how pleased the Lord is to be addressed by a name indicating His transcendental relationships with His intimate devotees, and knowing also the potency of the name Krishna, has chosen to glorify the Lord by addressing Him as Devak&#299;-nandana and Krishna. The king also addresses Him as Vrishni-vam&#347;a-prad&#299;pa ("the brilliant light in the Vrishni dynasty") because millions of generations of the Vrishni dynasty became sanctified by the Lord's appearance within it. The &#347;&#257;stras state that a family in which a pure devotee is born is sanctified for one hundred generations of ancestors and descendants. And the &#347;&#257;stras also state that every place within a radius of one hundred miles from where a devotee is born becomes sanctified. If a devotee can sanctify the place and family of his birth so extraordinarily, then what to speak of how completely the Lord can sanctify the place and family in which He chooses to take His birth.</P><P>The Lord's birth on the face of the earth is certainly very mysterious, and therefore it is difficult for ordinary men to believe in His birth. How can the all-powerful Lord take birth, seemingly like an ordinary man? The matter is explained in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/4/6.htm">4.6</A>), where the Lord says,</P><P>ajo 'pi sann avyay&#257;tm&#257; bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;m &#299;&#347;varo 'pi san</P><P CLASS=n>prakritim sv&#257;m adhishth&#257;ya sambhav&#257;my &#257;tma-m&#257;yay&#257;</P><P>"Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all living entities, by My transcendental potency I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form." From the &#347;&#257;stra we learn that the Lord takes birth not only in the family of human beings but also in the families of demigods, aquatics, animals, and so on. One may argue that an ordinary living being is eternal and unborn like the Lord and also takes birth in different species of life, and so there is no difference between the Lord and an ordinary living being. The difference is, however, that while an ordinary living being changes his body when he transmigrates from one species of life to another, the Lord never changes His body: He appears in His original body, without any change. Also, while there is a vast difference between the ordinary living entity and his body, there is no difference between the Lord and His body because He is pure spirit. In other words, there is no distinction between His body and His soul.</P><P>The word avyay&#257;tm&#257; in the above verse from the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; clearly indicates that the Lord's body is not made of material elements. He is all spirit. Birth and death apply only to the material body. The body of the ordinary living being is made of material elements and is therefore subject to birth and death. But the Lord's body, being all spiritual and thus eternal, neither takes birth nor dies. Nor can the Lord be forced to take birth in some particular family due to His past deeds, as an ordinary living being is.</P><P>The Lord is the supreme controller of the material elements, and being endless and beginningless, He exists in all times &#8212; past, present, and future. And because He is absolute, He has nothing to do with vice and virtue. In other words, for Him "vices" and "virtues" are one and the same; otherwise the Lord would not be the Absolute Truth.</P><P>Since the Lord appears by His internal potency, His incarnations in different species of life are not the creation of the external potency, M&#257;y&#257;. Therefore those who think that the Supreme Lord appears in different forms by accepting a body made of material elements are wrong; their vision is imperfect because they do not understand how the Lord's internal potency works. The Vedas inquire, Where does the Supreme Lord stand? And the reply is immediately given: He stands on His internal potency. So the conclusion is that although the Lord may seem to assume a material body when He takes birth, like an ordinary being, in fact He does not, for there is no difference between Him and His body. Thus He remains the Absolute Truth in all His appearances in different species of life.</P><P>In other words, the living being and the Supreme Lord appear in this material world under different circumstances. One can easily understand these different circumstances if one understands how the Lord's different potencies work. As explained before, the Lord has three kinds of potency, namely, internal, marginal, and external. We have wide experience of the external, or material, potency, but we generally fail to inquire about the actions and reactions of the other two potencies. A simple example will help us understand how the Lord's potencies work. Consider three identities: God, a man, and a doll. The doll consists of material energy, the man is a combination of material and spiritual energy, and God consists wholly of spiritual energy. The doll is all matter, internally and externally. Man is externally matter but internally spirit. And God is all spirit, both internally and externally. As the doll is all matter, so God is all spirit. But the man is half spirit and half matter.</P><P>Thus the body of God and the body of a living being are differently constituted. Because the Lord's body is pure spirit, it never deteriorates, and therefore He is called avyay&#257;tm&#257;. His body is absolute, beginningless, unborn, and eternal, while the material body of the living being is relative and therefore temporary &#8212; it undergoes birth and death. The living being himself, of course, is eternal, and if He so desires he can realize his eternality by merging into the body of the Absolute Truth or being reinstated in his constitutional position as an eternal servant of the Lord. If he does not do so, then his eternality is still maintained, but he remains ignorant of it.</P><P>The conclusion is that the Personality of Godhead appears in His original body, without any change, and this is made possible by His inconceivable potency. We should always remember that nothing is impossible for the omnipotent Lord. If He so desires, He can transform material energy into spiritual energy. Indeed, if he so desires He can bring the entire spiritual nature within the material nature, without the spiritual nature being affected by the material modes in any way.</P><P>The Lord's different potencies remain tightly under His control. In fact, the Lord actually has only one potency &#8212; namely, the internal potency &#8212; which He employs for different purposes. The situation is similar to how one uses electricity. The same electricity can be used for both heating and cooling. Such contradictory results are due to the expert handling of a technician. In the same way, by His supreme will the Lord employs His one internal potency to accomplish many different purposes. That is the information we get from the &#347;rutis (&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upanishad <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/6/8">6.8</A>): par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate.</P><P>The present verse of the Mukunda-m&#257;l&#257;-stotra states that the color of the Lord's body is blackish, like that of a new cloud. Also, His body is very soft. Softness of the body is a sign of a great personality. The &#347;&#257;stras state that the following bodily features indicate a great personality: a reddish luster in seven places &#8212; the eyes, the palms, the soles, the palate, the lips, the tongue, and the nails; broadness in three places &#8212; the waist, the forehead, and the chest; shortness in three places &#8212; the neck, the thighs, and the genitals; deepness in three places &#8212; the voice, the intelligence, and the navel; highness in five places &#8212; the nose, the arms, the ears, the forehead, and the thighs; and fineness in five places &#8212; the skin, the hair on the head, the bodily hair, the teeth, and the fingertips. All these features are present in the body of the Lord.</P><P>The Brahma-samhit&#257; confirms that the color the Lord's body is blackish, like that of a new cloud. But this blackish color is so beautiful that it surpasses the beauty of millions of Cupids. So this blackish color does not correspond to any blackish color in the material world.</P><P>Such descriptions of the Lord's body are not imaginary; rather, they are the statements of those who have seen the Lord with their supernatural vision. This supernatural vision is bestowed upon devotees like Brahm&#257; and upon those who follow the footsteps of pure devotees like him. But upstarts and unbelievers cannot have any access to this transcendental vision, for they lack the required submission to the will of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=376"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
