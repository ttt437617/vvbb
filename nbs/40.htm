As Lord Caitanya declared to &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;:</P><P>brahm&#257;nda bhramite kona bh&#257;gyav&#257;n j&#299;va</P><P CLASS=n>guru-krishna-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja</P><P>"According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down to the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Krishna. By the mercy of both Krishna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service" (Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../cc/madhya/19/151.htm">Madhya 19.151</A>).</P><P>In His Param&#257;tm&#257; feature, Lord Krishna is situated in everyone's heart, and He fulfills our desires in accordance with what we deserve, which is based on our previous activities. (Even sinful desires must be sanctioned by Krishna before one can fulfill them.) &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da writes, "If the living entity by chance or fortune comes in contact with the Krishna consciousness movement and wishes to associate with that movement, Krishna, who is situated in everyone's heart, gives him the chance to meet a bona fide spiritual master" (Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../cc/madhya/19/151.htm">Madhya 19.151</A>, purport). If one doesn't know exactly what or who he is looking for, but he calls out to God and asks to be delivered, the Lord will bestow His mercy &#8212; the chance to surrender to a great soul.</P><P>N&#257;rada's disciple Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is an example of one who was helped by God. Dhruva was insulted by his stepmother, and on the advice of his mother he went to seek God in the forest. Although the boy desired an exalted position and revenge, his determination appealed to the Supreme Lord. Dhruva wandered in the forest asking the animals, "Where is God? Are you God?" &#8212; and suddenly the great sage N&#257;rada appeared before him. &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da explains,</P><P>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is present in everyone's heart, and as soon as He understands that the living entity is serious about entering devotional service, He sends His representative. In this way N&#257;rada was sent to Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja.
