By cultivating such knowledge one gradually becomes advanced on the path of liberation, and thereafter he is freed, and his attraction becomes fixed. Then real devotion and devotional service begin.</P><P>Thus consciously engaged in devotional service in the association of devotees, a person gains distaste for sense gratification, both in this world and in the next, by constantly thinking about the activities of the Lord. This process of Krishna consciousness is the easiest process of mystic power; when one is actually situated on that path of devotional service, he is able to control the mind.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The process of advancing in Krishna consciousness and devotional service is described here. The first point is that one must seek the association of persons who are Krishna conscious and who engage in devotional service. Without such association one cannot advance. Simply by theoretical knowledge or study one cannot make any appreciable advancement. One must give up the association of materialistic persons and seek the association of devotees because without such association one cannot understand the activities of the Lord. Generally, people are convinced of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Because they do not associate with devotees, they cannot understand that the Absolute Truth can be a person and have personal activities. This is a very difficult subject matter, and unless one has personal understanding of the Absolute Truth, there is no meaning to devotion. Service or devotion cannot be offered to anything impersonal. Service must be offered to a person. Nondevotees cannot appreciate Krishna consciousness by reading the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam or any other Vedic literature wherein the activities of the Lord are described; they think that these activities are fictional, because spiritual life is not explained to them in the proper mood. To understand the personal activities of the Lord, one has to seek the association of devotees, and by such association, when one contemplates and tries to understand the transcendental activities of the Lord, the path to liberation is open, and he is freed. One who has firm faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes fixed, and his attraction for association with the Lord and the devotees increases. Association with devotees means association with the Lord. The devotee who makes this association develops the consciousness for rendering service to the Lord, and then, being situated in the transcendental position of devotional service, he gradually becomes perfect.</P><P>In all scriptures people are encouraged to act in a pious way so that they can enjoy sense gratification not only in this life but also in the next. For example, one is promised promotion to the heavenly kingdom of higher planets by pious fruitive activities. But a devotee in the association of devotees prefers to contemplate the activities of the Lord&#8212;how He has created this universe, how He is maintaining it, how the creation dissolves, and how in the spiritual kingdom the Lord's pastimes are enacted. There are full literatures describing these activities, especially Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, Brahma-samhit&#257; and &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam. The sincere devotee who associates with devotees gets the opportunity to hear and contemplate these subjects, and the result is that he feels distaste for so-called happiness in this or that world, in heaven or on other planets. The devotees are simply interested in being transferred to the personal association of the Lord; they are no longer attracted to temporary so-called happiness. That is the position of one who is yoga-yukta. One who is fixed in mystic power is not disturbed by the allurement of this world or that world; he is interested in spiritual understanding. This is very easily attained by the easiest process, bhakti-yoga. Rijubhir yoga-m&#257;rgaih. A very suitable word used here is rijubhih, or "very easy." There are different processes of yoga-m&#257;rga, attaining yoga perfection, but this process, devotional service to the Lord, is the easiest. Not only is it the easiest process, but the result is sublime. Everyone, therefore, should try this process of Krishna consciousness and reach the highest perfection.</P><P>Sat means "existence," and asat means "that which does not exist," that which is temporary. The material world is asat; therefore the Vedas enjoin: asato m&#257; sad gama: "Do not remain within this material world." Those who are interested in materialistic life are also called asat. When asked how a Vaishnava behaves, Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu replied, asat-sa&#324;ga-ty&#257;ga&#8212;ei vaishnava-&#257;c&#257;ra: "A devotee first of all avoids the company of asat, those who are materially interested." (Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../cc/madhya/22/87.htm">Madhya 22.87</A>) We have established this Krishna consciousness movement in order to avoid asat-sa&#324;ga, association with those who are interested in material things. Because we are associating with Krishna, we do not wish to talk about anything but Krishna. Everyone is interested in this business or that, and we are exclusively interested in our Krishna consciousness business. Those who are asat are very much attached to sense gratification, and the culmination of sense gratification is sex.</P><P>In addition, &#346;r&#299; San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; in his Hari-bhakti-vil&#257;sa recommends that one should not hear Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, the pur&#257;nas, the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam or any hari-kath&#257; from anyone who is not a Vaishnava in his actions. That means that we should not hear these Vedic literatures from the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, who actually do not accept Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How can one not accept Krishna as the Supreme Lord and yet dare to speak on Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;? We will never derive any benefit from listening to the commentaries of such people. Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; and &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam should be heard from the devotees. We can hear Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; from M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s for hundreds of years and yet never understand Krishna. It is therefore forbidden for Vaishnavas to hear talks given by M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s.</P><P>Hari-kath&#257;, talks about &#346;r&#299; Hari, or Krishna, are amrita, nectar. If one hears them from the right source, he attains amrita (so 'mritatv&#257;ya kalpate). Mrita means "birth and death," and amrita means "the cessation of birth and death." Spiritual life means putting an end to birth, old age, disease and death. Getting amrita, nectar, means getting relief from birth and death, and that is the real aim of spiritual life. Lord Krishna says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/7/16.htm">7.16</A>) that spiritual life begins when one is pious:</P><P>catur-vidh&#257; bhajante m&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>jan&#257;h sukritino 'rjuna</P><P CLASS=n>&#257;rto jijñ&#257;sur arth&#257;rth&#299;</P><P CLASS=n>jñ&#257;n&#299; ca bharatarshabha</P><P>"O best among the Bh&#257;ratas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me&#8212;the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute."</P><P>If we actually want to become pious and develop our devotional life, we have to associate unflinchingly with a s&#257;dhu. Then we can acquire some taste for Krishna. When we discuss Krishna with a s&#257;dhu, the discussion becomes very pleasing, and we develop some taste, which is called rasa, or mellow. Rasa is the enjoyment we derive from drinking something very nice when we are thirsty. Krishna has instructed us to think of Him when drinking water. This is not very difficult. Krishna also tells us to think of Him when we see sunlight in the morning. Why do we say, "Can you show me God?" God is showing us Himself. Why do we close our eyes to try to see Him? He says, "I am this, and I am that." It is not that suddenly we can expect to see God, but we can become qualified to see God through the association of a s&#257;dhu. Presently many people are interested in receiving degrees from big universities, but education without God consciousness is simply an expansion of m&#257;y&#257;'s influence. Because knowledge is taken away by illusion, the universities are simply presenting impediments on the path of God consciousness. The living entity is already illusioned when he comes into the material world, and so-called advanced education simply increases his illusion. Trying to become happy in this temporary, material life, the living entity has forgotten that he is the eternal servant of Krishna. Even if one becomes happy in this temporary life, his happiness is an illusion because no one is allowed to stay and enjoy his happiness. These points have to be understood in the association of devotees. A devotee knows everything because he has seen the Supreme Absolute Truth, Krishna.</P><P>What is the goal of ved&#257;nta-dar&#347;ana? Veda means "knowledge," and anta means "ultimate." What is that ultimate knowledge? In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/15/15.htm">15.15</A>) &#346;r&#299; Krishna says:</P><P>vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedyo</P><P CLASS=n>ved&#257;nta-krid veda-vid eva c&#257;ham</P><P>"By all the Vedas, I am to be known; indeed, I am the compiler of Ved&#257;nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas."</P><P>If we listen to Krishna and understand what and who He is, we can actually understand Ved&#257;nta. If we do not understand Krishna but advertise ourselves as Ved&#257;ntists, we are just being illusioned. Without understanding Krishna, one is actually a m&#363;dha, a fool. People do not know it, but actually anyone in the material world is more or less a m&#363;dha. We are all m&#363;dhas, for unless we are m&#363;dhas, we do not come into the material world. From Brahm&#257; down to the smallest ant, we are all m&#363;dhas of different degrees. In order to become really learned, we have to associate with devotees. Then we can actually relish krishna-kath&#257;. When discussed among devotees, krishna-kath&#257; is pleasing to the heart and ear. This requires a little training, and this training is given by the devotees. We should follow the devotees in their practical daily life, in their routine work and behavior. Cultivation means practice, and the great &#257;c&#257;ryas have given a routine we can cultivate. For instance, The Nectar of Devotion by &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; deals with the cultivation of devotional service, and this book, which we have translated, has been very well received in European and American universities. Bhakti-ras&#257;mrita-sindhu, The Nectar of Devotion, is the actual science of bhakti. Bhakti is not sentiment; it is a great science, and we have to learn it scientifically. lt is not that we have to wait for another life to cultivate devotional service. We can read The Nectar of Devotion, live with devotees, rise early in the morning to attend ma&#324;gala-&#257;rati, study Vedic literature, take pras&#257;da and preach Krishna consciousness.</P><P>M&#257;y&#257; is very strong, and to begin devotional service is to declare war against m&#257;y&#257;. Some of the devotees in this Krishna consciousness movement may fall down, but whatever is done sincerely is to their permanent credit. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. If one renders a little devotional service, he does not fall down into the lower species but again attains a human form. There are 8,400,000 species, but the fallen devotee is guaranteed a human life. If one becomes Krishna conscious, he is assured of a good birth in the next life. However, if one completes his Krishna consciousness in this life, he will not take birth again but will go to Krishna. This is what is actually wanted. Why take the chance of being born into a rich family or a br&#257;hmana family? Actually, such a birth is quite risky because there is really no guarantee. Generally, those who are rich don't care at all for Krishna consciousness, and those who are born in br&#257;hmana families generally become puffed-up, thinking, "I am a br&#257;hmana. I am born in a very high family." Thinking this brings about their falldown. It is said that pride precedes a fall. A Vaishnava is by nature very humble.</P><P>These are the chances one takes when one becomes a human being. Krishna is personally advising us to take up the opportunities offered by the Krishna consciousness movement. We should take them and not run the risk of committing spiritual suicide.</P><P>This is the process for understanding the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Person, the Supreme Being. In the Absolute, there are no contradictions. Krishna's name, form, activities, paraphernalia and attributes are identical with Krishna. This is the meaning of absolute. There is no difference between Krishna's form and Krishna. Krishna's hands and Krishna's legs are nondifferent. In the material world, there is a difference between our left hand and our right hand, between the nose and the ear, but these dualities do not exist in Krishna. This is the meaning of absolute. As stated in Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bs/5/32.htm">5.32</A>):</P><P>a&#324;g&#257;ni yasya sakalendriya-vrittimanti</P><P CLASS=n>pa&#347;yanti p&#257;nti kalayanti ciram jaganti</P><P CLASS=n>&#257;nanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya</P><P CLASS=n>govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi</P><P>"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental form is full of bliss, truth and substantiality, and is thus full of the most dazzling splendor. Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses, in Himself, the full-fledged functions of all the organs, and eternally sees, maintains and manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane." The different parts of our bodies serve different purposes, but any limb of Krishna's body can serve any purpose. Krishna can eat through His eyes, or Krishna can go somewhere simply by thinking. The Absolute is advaita. There is no duality in the Absolute. Everything is one.</P><P>Our material disease lies in wanting to satisfy our senses. We have stated before that advancement of civilization means advancement of sense gratification, but bhakti means just the opposite. As long as we are interested in sense gratification, there is no question of bhakti. We have to reduce our tendency for sense gratification and increase our devotional activities. We have also stated that material bondage means accepting one body and creating another. Krishna, through nature, will give us full facility to enjoy our senses. Presently in the Western countries it has become fashionable to run around naked. Therefore nature will give these people an opportunity to stand naked like trees for many years. Why are we receiving different bodies? Because we have different tendencies for sense gratification. We actually have to come to detest sense gratification before our spiritual life begins. This is made possible through bhakti. Although Krishna is beyond our vision, He has agreed to be seen by us through the arc&#257;-vigraha, the Deity. We should not think that the Deity is made of stone. Even if it is stone, we should think that Krishna has made Himself visible before us like a stone because we cannot see beyond stone. That is Krishna's mercy. Because our eyes and other senses are imperfect, we cannot see Krishna present everywhere in His original spiritual form. Because we are imperfect, we see the difference between things spiritual and material, but Krishna, being absolute, knows no such distinctions. He can become spiritual or material, however He likes, and it does not make any difference to Him. Being almighty and omnipotent, Krishna can change matter into spirit and spirit into matter. Therefore we should not think, as the atheists do, that we are worshiping idols. Even if it is an idol, it is still Krishna. That is the absolute nature of Krishna. Even if we think that the Deity is a stone, or a piece of metal or some wood, He is still Krishna. The understanding of this requires bhakti on our part. If we are a little thoughtful and philosophical, and if we are at all inclined toward bhakti, we can understand that Krishna is present in stone.</P><P>Actually, nothing is different from Krishna because everything is Krishna's energy. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers say that since everything is God, the personality of Krishna is finished. But actually Krishna is Krishna, and at the same time He is everything. We can understand this by bhakti, but not by any other process. When a bhakta sees a tree, he sees Krishna. As explained in Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita (<A CLASS=v HREF="../cc/madhya/8/274.htm">Madhya 8.274</A>):</P><P>sth&#257;vara ja&#324;gama dekhe, n&#257; dekhe t&#257;ra m&#363;rti</P><P CLASS=n>sarvatra haya nija ishta-deva-sph&#363;rti</P><P>The advanced devotee does not see living entities as moving and not moving. He sees Krishna. This is also stated in the Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bs/5/38.htm">5.38</A>):</P><P>prem&#257;ñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena</P><P CLASS=n>santah sadaiva hridayeshu vilokayanti</P><P>Because his eyes are always smeared with the ointment of devotion, the devotee always sees Krishna and nothing else. He sees Krishna and Krishna's energy everywhere. For instance, if you love your child, when you see your child's shoe, you immediately see your child. Or if you see your child's toy, you immediately see your child and hear his voice. Similarly, if we have actually developed love of Krishna, nothing exists but Krishna. When our love for Krishna is actually developed, whatever we see, we will see Krishna.</P><P>Unless one is advanced in krishna-prem&#257;, love of Krishna, he cannot see or understand. By the blunt material senses, we cannot even understand the name of Krishna. People are always asking, "Why are these people chanting Hare Krishna?" They cannot understand, although Krishna realization begins with the name. The name of Krishna and Krishna are nondifferent, but we cannot realize this intellectually. We have to practice chanting Hare Krishna to realize it. When we actually advance in devotional service and chant the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra offenselessly, we will realize that Krishna and His name are nondifferent. Thus krishna-bhakti begins with the tongue, for we can utilize the tongue to chant, and to taste krishna-pras&#257;da. In this way we can become a Krishna bhakta.</P><P>When we see the Deity of Krishna in the temple, we should think that the Deity is Krishna. In this way Krishna has agreed to be seen by us and even dressed by us. However, if we think of Krishna's vir&#257;t-r&#363;pa, His universal form, what can we do? How can we dress the vir&#257;t-r&#363;pa? His many heads cover the sky, and we cannot even conceive of Him. Krishna can become bigger than the biggest and smaller than the smallest. Therefore this verse states: bhakty&#257; pum&#257;ñ j&#257;ta-vir&#257;ga aindriy&#257;t. The more we serve Krishna, give Him things to eat and dress Him nicely, the less we become interested in our own bodies. In the material world everyone is very busy dressing himself very nicely in order to be sexually attractive, but if we try to dress Krishna nicely, we will forget our own material dress. If we feed Krishna nice food, we will forget to satisfy our own tongue by going to this or that restaurant.</P><P>Krishna was teaching Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, and Arjuna was seeing Him face to face, but seeing Krishna and reading Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; are the same. Some people say that Arjuna was fortunate to have seen Krishna face to face and take instructions from Him, but Krishna can be seen immediately, provided one has the eyes to see. There is the example in Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita of a br&#257;hmana in South India who was reading Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, although he was illiterate. The people in the neighborhood knew that he was illiterate, and they made jokes, asking him, "Well, how is it you are reading Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;?" One day Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu happened to be in a temple nearby, and He could understand that this man was a devotee. He therefore approached him and asked, "My dear br&#257;hmana, what are you reading?" The br&#257;hmana replied, "I am reading Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, or, rather, I am trying to read Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. I happen to be illiterate, but my guru-mah&#257;r&#257;ja has said that I must read the eighteen chapters of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; daily. I am simply trying to carry out his order, and therefore I am opening and closing the pages." Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu then said, "I see that you are crying sometimes. Why is this?" The br&#257;hmana replied, "Yes, I am crying because when I take up this book, I see a picture of Krishna driving Arjuna's chariot. &#346;r&#299; Krishna is so kind that He has accepted the position of a servant to His devotee. Therefore when I see this picture, I weep." Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu then immediately embraced the br&#257;hmana and said, "You have actually read Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;."</P><P>It is not that a wealth of education is required. One does not even have to understand the language. The only ingredient needed is bhakti, love. If one becomes a pure bhakta, he will forget all material sense enjoyment. Being a bhakta doesn't simply mean wearing tilaka and robes. One is not a bhakta if he has a taste for material sense enjoyment. A true bhakta wants to satisfy not his senses but the senses of Krishna. That is the spiritual world. In the spiritual world, Vrind&#257;vana, everyone&#8212;mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;, the gop&#299;s, the cowherd boys, &#346;r&#299;d&#257;m&#257;, Sud&#257;m&#257;, the land, the water, the trees, the birds&#8212;all are trying to satisfy Krishna. That is the real meaning of Vrind&#257;vana. When Krishna left Vrind&#257;vana for Mathur&#257;, everyone in Vrind&#257;vana fell dead out of separation from Him. Similarly, we can always live in Vrind&#257;vana, in Vaikuntha, if we are mad after Krishna. This is the teaching of Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, and He illustrated this by His very life. When He was in Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299;, He was always mad after Krishna day and night. The last twelve years of His life were passed in madness. Sometimes He threw Himself into the ocean, and He wandered about like a madman. Of course, this is not possible for ordinary living entities. However, if we become bhaktas, we will find intelligence behind everything in the creation. If we take a flower and see its constitution, how it is made and how its colors are displayed and how it comes into existence, we can see Krishna. We can see how Krishna has created such a beautiful thing so intelligently. We should not consider like rascals that such a thing has come into being automatically. Fools cannot see, but those who are intelligent can see that the hand of the Supreme Lord is in everything within the creation. &#298;&#347;&#257;v&#257;syam idam sarvam.</P><P>Actually, nothing comes about automatically. Everything comes about through the intelligence of Krishna, through His fine and accurate powers. If we paint a picture of a flower, we have to arrange many facets, and still the picture will not be absolutely perfect. Yet the flower created by Krishna has come out perfectly. What rascal can say that there is no brain behind it? Krishna specifically says that we should not think that prakriti, nature, is working automatically. He says, "Nature is working under My direction." One simply has to develop the eyes to see how these things are going on. This is possible if we engage the senses in the service of Krishna. We first of all must engage the tongue in chanting Hare Krishna and in eating bhagavat-pras&#257;da. Nothing else is required. Therefore the Krishna consciousness movement is distributing pras&#257;da and engaging people in chanting the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.krishna.com"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
