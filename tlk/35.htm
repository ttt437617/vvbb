They like to see My various transcendental forms, which are all benevolent, and they also talk favorably with Me.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s and atheists accept the forms of the Deities in the temple of the Lord as idols, but devotees do not worship idols. They directly worship the Personality of Godhead in His arc&#257; incarnation. Arc&#257; refers to the form we can worship in our present condition. Actually in our present state it is not possible to see God in His spiritual form because our material eyes and senses cannot conceive of a spiritual form. We cannot even see the spiritual form of the individual soul. When a man dies we cannot see how the spiritual form leaves the body. That is the defect of our material senses. In order to be seen by our material senses, the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts a favorable form which is called arc&#257;-vigraha. This arc&#257;-vigraha, sometimes called the arc&#257; incarnation, is not different from Him. Just as the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts various incarnations, He takes on forms made out of matter&#8212;clay, wood, metal, jewels, etc.</P><P>There are many &#347;&#257;stric injunctions which give instructions for carving forms of the Lord. These forms are not material. If God is all-pervading, He is also in the material elements. There is no doubt about it. But the atheists think otherwise. Although they preach that everything is God, when they go to the temple and see the form of the Lord, they deny that He is God. According to their own theory, everything is God. Then why is the Deity not God? Actually, they have no conception of God. The devotees' vision, however, is different; their vision is smeared with love of God. As soon as they see the Lord in His different forms, the devotees become saturated with love, for they do not find any difference between the Lord and His form in the temple, as do the atheists. The smiling face of the Deity in the temple is beheld by the devotees as transcendental and spiritual, and the decorations on the body of the Lord are very much appreciated by the devotees. It is the duty of the spiritual master to teach his devotees how to decorate the Deity in the temple, how to cleanse the temple and how to worship the Deity. There are different procedures, rules and regulations followed in temples of Vishnu, and devotees go there and see the Deity, the vigraha, and spiritually enjoy the form, because all of the Deities are benevolent. The devotees express their minds before the Deity, and in many instances the Deity also gives answers. But one must be a very elevated devotee in order to be able to speak with the Supreme Lord. Sometimes the Lord informs the devotee through dreams. These exchanges between the Deity and the devotee are not understandable by atheists, but actually the devotee enjoys them.</P><P>Clearly, those who have the eyes to see Krishna will see Him. When Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu entered the temple of Jagann&#257;tha, He immediately fainted upon seeing the Deity. He said, "Oh, here is My Lord! Here is My Lord!" ln order to see, one has to become santah, and one becomes santah by culture. When we develop love of Krishna, we will immediately see Krishna and faint, saying, "Oh, here is my Lord!" However, those with no faith, those who are always trying to deny Krishna, will simply say, "Oh, this is an idol. This is simply a piece of stone."</P><P>We must be eager to see Krishna and talk with Him. He is actually waiting to see whether we are interested in talking with Him. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/10/10.htm">10.10</A>) &#346;r&#299; Krishna says:</P><P>tesh&#257;m satata-yukt&#257;n&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>bhajat&#257;m pr&#299;ti-p&#363;rvakam</P><P CLASS=n>dad&#257;mi buddhi-yogam tam</P><P CLASS=n>yena m&#257;m upay&#257;nti te</P><P>"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me."</P><P>If we want to talk to some important man, we must have some qualification. It is not that we can immediately talk to presidents or even to senators just because we want to talk to them. Somehow or other we must comply with certain rules and regulations. Krishna is ready to talk to us, and for this purpose He has descended in the arc&#257;-m&#363;rti, the Deity, in order to be seen. We simply have to qualify ourselves to talk with Him. The nondevotees, M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, who are interested in denying Krishna, say that God has no eyes, no legs, no hands, no ears and so on. This is indirectly saying that God is blind and deaf and that He cannot do this or that. In this way, they are indirectly insulting God. This is blasphemy. God does not want to hear such nonsense. Therefore it is said in this verse: s&#257;kam v&#257;cam sprihan&#299;y&#257;m vadanti. By saying that Krishna is blind, that He has no eyes, no hands, no nothing, we are indirectly saying that Krishna does not exist. This is certainly not a favorable way to talk about Krishna. If we want to talk about Krishna, we must consult the Vedic literatures. Then we can understand how Krishna should be worshiped.</P><P>In Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bs/5/29.htm">5.29</A>) it is stated: "&#346;r&#299; Krishna is playing on His flute, and His eyes are as beautiful as the petals of a lotus flower. He wears a peacock feather in His hair, and His form is very beautiful." The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s say, "Just imagine some form of God." But God's form cannot be imagined. God's form is not imaginary but factual. This factual information we receive from the Vedas. When Krishna was present on this earth, He exhibited His form and activities. All of these are divine, not material. Krishna's body is sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha [<A CLASS=v HREF="../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>]. It has nothing to do with anything material. He descends as a favor to His devotees, who are always anxious to see Him. His first business is to give pleasure to His devotees, and His second business is to kill the demons, who are always giving the devotees trouble. It is the nature of demons to give devotees trouble, just as in the West, Lord Jesus Christ was crucified because he was preaching God consciousness. Similarly, Hiranyaka&#347;ipu tried to kill his five-year-old boy Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja because his son was talking about Krishna. There were many demons who tried to kill Krishna Himself, great demons like P&#363;tan&#257;, Agh&#257;sura, Bak&#257;sura and Kamsa. Nonetheless, Krishna destroys them all by His omnipotence.</P><P>Actually everyone in the material world is more or less an asura, an atheist. If one preaches, one has to learn to tolerate the asuras and speak in such a way that they can also become devotees. We should always speak of Krishna in a pleasing way; then we will be benefited. Another name for Krishna is Uttama&#347;loka, which indicates that He is worshiped by the best selected words. It is not that we should use any words we choose. There are many prayers in the Vedic scriptures and also in the Bible and Koran. Although the Christians and Muhammadans do not worship the Deity, they offer prayers to the Lord, and that is also bhakti. Arcanam vandanam.</P><P>There are nine different processes for worshiping the Lord, and one may accept one or all of them. We should use very selected words and surrender unto Krishna, but we should not say things which do not please Him. We should not claim that God is formless and that He has no eyes, no head or whatever. Actually it is stated in the Vedas that Krishna has no hand but that He can accept our offering. This means that He has no material hand. If He actually has no hand, how can He extend His hand millions of miles to accept an offering? Goloka Vrind&#257;vana is many trillions and trillions of miles away, but Krishna can accept whatever we offer. When the Vedas say that God has no hands, it is meant that He has no material hands. His hands are sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha [<A CLASS=v HREF="../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>]. If we can understand Krishna's activities, form, qualities and pastimes in this way, we become fit to return home, back to Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.krishna.com"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
