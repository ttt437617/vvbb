Please let me know the nature of that yoga system. How many ways are there by which one can understand in truth that sublime yoga?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>There are different kinds of mystic yoga systems aiming for different phases of the Absolute Truth. The jñ&#257;na-yoga system aims at the impersonal Brahman effulgence, and the hatha-yoga system aims at the localized personal aspect, the Param&#257;tm&#257; feature of the Absolute Truth, whereas bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, which is executed in nine different ways, headed by hearing and chanting, aims at complete realization of the Supreme Lord. There are different methods of self-realization. But here Devah&#363;ti especially refers to the bhakti-yoga system, which has already been primarily explained by the Lord. The different processes of the bhakti-yoga system are hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping the Lord in the temple, accepting service to Him, carrying out His orders, making friends with Him and ultimately surrendering everything for His service.</P><P>The word nirv&#257;n&#257;tman is very significant in this verse. Unless one accepts the process of devotional service, one cannot end the continuation of material existence. As far as jñ&#257;n&#299;s are concerned, they are interested in jñ&#257;na-yoga, but even if one elevates oneself, after a great performance of austerity, to the Brahman effulgence, there is a chance of falling down again to the material world. Therefore, jñ&#257;na-yoga does not actually end material existence. Similarly, regarding the hatha-yoga system, which aims at the localized aspect of the Lord, Param&#257;tm&#257;, it has been experienced that many yog&#299;s, such as Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra, fall down. But bhakti-yog&#299;s, once approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead, never come back to this material world, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. Yad gatv&#257; na nivartante: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/15/6.htm">Bg. 15.6</A>] upon going, one never comes back. Tyaktv&#257; deham punar janma naiti: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/4/9.htm">Bg. 4.9</A>] after giving up this body, he never comes back again to accept a material body. Nirv&#257;na does not finish the existence of the soul. The soul is ever-existing. Therefore nirv&#257;na means to end one's material existence, and to end material existence means to go back home, back to Godhead.</P><P>Sometimes it is asked how the living entity falls down from the spiritual world to the material world. Here is the answer. Unless one is elevated to the Vaikuntha planets and is directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is prone to fall down, either from the impersonal Brahman realization or from an ecstatic trance of meditation. Another word in this verse, bhagavad-b&#257;nah, is very significant. B&#257;nah means "arrow." The bhakti-yoga system is just like an arrow aiming up to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The bhakti-yoga system never urges one toward the impersonal Brahman effulgence or to the point of Param&#257;tm&#257; realization. This b&#257;nah, or arrow, is so sharp and swift that it goes directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, penetrating the regions of impersonal Brahman and localized Param&#257;tm&#257;.</P><P>We must understand the Supreme Person, tattvatah, in truth. Generally people are not interested in knowing about God or their relationship with Him. However, the entire Vedic instruction is for this purpose. First of all we have to know God, then we have to know our relationship with God. The next step is acting on the basis of that relationship. Krishna states that out of many millions of people, one may be interested in knowing the purpose of life. Human life is meant for this end, and if one does not come to this understanding, he is no better than an animal. We not only have to understand God and our relationship with Him but also how to act in that relationship. In this way we can perfect our lives. When one is a siddha, one understands himself&#8212;that is, one understands, aham brahm&#257;smi: "I am not this body." This is Brahman realization, the brahma-bh&#363;ta platform. When one attains this stage, he becomes very happy. However, we must progress beyond this and come to the platform of bhakti-yoga. On that platform, there is variety and &#257;nanda, bliss. As stated previously, we are seeking spiritual variety, and if we do not enter the spiritual world, we will again fall down into the material atmosphere.</P><P>The varieties of the spiritual world are mentioned in the Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bs/5/29.htm">5.29-30</A>):</P><P>cint&#257;mani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vriksha-</P><P CLASS=n>laksh&#257;vriteshu surabh&#299;r abhip&#257;layantam</P><P CLASS=n>lakshm&#299;-sahasra-&#347;ata-sambhrama-sevyam&#257;nam</P><P CLASS=n>govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi</P><P CLASS=n>venum kvanantam aravinda-dal&#257;yat&#257;ksham</P><P CLASS=n>barh&#257;vatamsam asit&#257;mbuda-sundar&#257;&#324;gam</P><P CLASS=n>kandarpa-koti-kaman&#299;ya-vi&#347;esha-&#347;obham</P><P CLASS=n>govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi</P><P>"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, yielding all desires, in abodes built with spiritual gems and surrounded by millions of purpose trees. He is always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune.</P><P>"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept in playing on His flute, with blooming eyes like lotus petals, with head decked with peacock's feather, with the figure of beauty tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and His unique loveliness charming millions of Cupids."</P><P>We should not consider Krishna's form to be imagined by some artist. He is described in the Vedas as venum kvanantam aravinda-dal&#257;yat&#257;ksham [<A CLASS=v HREF="../bs/5/30.htm">Bs. 5.30</A>]. He plays a flute, and His eyes are like the petals of a lotus flower. He wears a peacock feather, and His complexion is very beautiful, like a dark cloud. He is so beautiful that He attracts many hundreds of thousands of Cupids (kandarpa-koti-kaman&#299;ya-vi&#347;esha-&#347;obham). These are descriptions of Govinda found in the &#347;&#257;stras.</P><P>In the material world we are simply chewing the chewed, throwing it away, picking it up and then chewing it again. Spiritual variety is not like this. Spiritual variety is &#257;nand&#257;mbudhi-vardhanam: it is constantly increasing. It is even greater than the ocean, because the ocean does not increase. The shores of the ocean are set; they have certain limits. However, the ocean of bliss is constantly increasing. The more we enter into that spiritual bliss, the more we become joyful.</P><P>The young people in the Hare Krishna movement chant the Hare Krishna mantra all the time. If this mantra were material, how long would they chant it? It is not possible to chant a material name for very long because the chanting would become hackneyed and very tiresome. No one could be satisfied simply by chanting Hare Krishna unless Hare Krishna itself were spiritual. We may chant, "Mr. John, Mr. John, Mr. John," but after an hour we will be fed up. However, the more we become spiritually advanced, the more bliss we will derive from chanting Hare Krishna.</P><P>We can experience &#257;nanda perfectly in the association of Krishna. We can associate with Krishna as a servant, a friend, a father, a mother or a conjugal lover. There are five basic rasas&#8212;&#347;&#257;nta, d&#257;sya, sakhya, v&#257;tsalya and m&#257;dhurya. In this material world, we experience the same rasas, or relationships. We are related to someone as a father, a son, a lover, a beloved, a master, a servant or whatever. These are perverted reflections of the relationship with Krishna found in the spiritual world. Today in the material world I may be relishing my love for my son, but tomorrow my son may be my greatest enemy. There is no eternity in this kind of love. Or, if my son does not become my enemy, he may die. Today I may love some man or woman, but tomorrow we may break up. All of this is due to the defects of the material world. However, in the spiritual world these relationships never break up. They simply increase and increase, and this is called perfection.</P><P>Krishna is very fond of tending surabhi cows, but the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s cannot understand this. They say, "What is this Krishna?" Even Lord Brahm&#257; was bewildered. He said, "How is it that this Krishna, this boy of Vrind&#257;vana, is being worshiped? He is called the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How is that?" Lord Indra was also bewildered. Therefore if we do not wish to be bewildered we have to understand Krishna in truth from Krishna Himself or His bona fide representative.</P><P>The activities of Krishna are not ordinary but divine. If we can understand this, we immediately become liberated. We need only understand the pastimes of Krishna with the gop&#299;s. These pastimes are not ordinary. In the material world, a young man wants to dance with many young girls, but Krishna's dancing with the gop&#299;s is different. Because people cannot understand Krishna, when they hear about Krishna's dancing with the gop&#299;s, they take this as some kind of concession, and say, "Now let us dance with young girls." In this way they go to hell. Therefore we have to learn from the proper person about Krishna's activities. We should not immediately try to understand Krishna's dealings with the gop&#299;s, for they are very confidential. These dealings are given in the Tenth Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, and this indicates that we have to understand Krishna as He is by first reading the preceding nine cantos. When we have understood these nine cantos, we can go on to the tenth. In this way we can understand that Krishna's activities are not ordinary but divine, and we can immediately become liberated.</P><P>We may either hear about Krishna, chant His names, worship Him or offer prayers. In any case, we should work under the directions of our spiritual master or &#346;r&#299; Krishna Himself. For instance, Hanum&#257;n simply carried out Lord R&#257;macandra's orders. Hanum&#257;n apparently had no education, and he was not capable of teaching Ved&#257;nta, but he simply carried out the orders of Lord R&#257;macandra and attained perfection. Arjuna, on the other hand, took Krishna as his most intimate friend. Arjuna was not a Ved&#257;ntist but a fighter, a warrior. He had no time to study Ved&#257;nta because he had to deal with war and politics, but still he was the greatest devotee. People may say, "Oh, Arjuna was not a Ved&#257;ntist, nor even a br&#257;hmana or a sanny&#257;s&#299;. How could Krishna accept him as a devotee?" Nonetheless, in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/4/3.htm">4.3</A>), Krishna says that Arjuna is His very dear friend and devotee: bhakto 'si me sakh&#257; ceti. If one becomes a devotee, there is no material impediment.</P><P>Actually bhakti should be automatic and spontaneous. There should be no motive in serving Krishna, but even if there is a motive, service rendered unto Krishna is good. Even if one approaches Krishna with some ulterior motive, one is considered pious. For instance, Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja initially worshiped Krishna with a motive, but after attaining perfection in devotional service, his ulterior motive vanished. When he actually saw Krishna, he said, "I do not want anything from You. I don't want any benediction other than Your service." After hearing about the many transcendental qualities of Krishna, if we somehow or other become attracted to Krishna consciousness, our lives will be successful. Tasm&#257;t ken&#257;py up&#257;yena manah krishne nive&#347;ayet: "Somehow or other we have to attach our minds to Krishna consciousness." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../sb/7/1/32.htm">7.1.32</A>) Then Krishna will help us and give us intelligence from within, as He indicates in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; ( <A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/10/10.htm">10.10</A>):</P><P>tesh&#257;m satata-yukt&#257;n&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>bhajat&#257;m pr&#299;ti-p&#363;rvakam</P><P CLASS=n>dad&#257;mi buddhi-yogam tam</P><P CLASS=n>yena m&#257;m upay&#257;nti te</P><P>"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me." This is actual buddhi-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means buddhi-yoga, because one who is highly intelligent decides to take to Krishna consciousness. In this way, one can perfect his life by engaging in devotional service under the directions of the &#347;&#257;stras and the spiritual master. Devah&#363;ti understands this and is thus submitting to her son just as Arjuna submitted to &#346;r&#299; Krishna on the battlefield.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.krishna.com"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
