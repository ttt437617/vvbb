Fire burns out of fear of Me, and death goes about taking its toll out of fear of Me.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, says in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; that the natural laws are perfect because of His superintendence. No one should think that nature is working automatically, without superintendence. The Vedic literature says that the clouds are controlled by the demigod Indra, heat is distributed by the sun-god, the soothing moonlight is distributed by Candra and the air is blowing under the arrangement of the demigod V&#257;yu. But above all these demigods is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the chief living entity. Nityo nity&#257;n&#257;m cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m. The demigods are also ordinary living entities, but due to their faithfulness&#8212;their devotional service&#8212;they have been promoted to such posts. These different demigods, or directors, such as Candra, Varuna and V&#257;yu, are called adhik&#257;ri-devat&#257;. The demigods are departmental heads. The government of the Supreme Lord consists not only of one planet or two or three; there are millions of planets and millions of universes. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has a huge government, and He requires assistants. The demigods are considered His bodily limbs. These are described in Vedic literature. The sun-god, moon-god, fire-god and air-god are working under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (9. 10), may&#257;dhyakshena prakritih s&#363;yate sa-car&#257;caram. The natural laws are being conducted under His superintendence. Because He is in the background, everything is being performed punctually and regularly.</P><P>One who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely protected from all other influences. He no longer serves or is obliged to anyone else. Of course he is not disobedient to anyone, but his full power of thought is absorbed in the service of the Lord. The statements by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kapila, that under His direction the air is blowing, the fire is burning, the sun is giving heat, etc., are not sentimental. The impersonalist may say that the Bh&#257;gavatam devotees create and imagine someone as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and assign qualifications to Him; but actually it is neither imagination nor an imposition of artificial power in the name of Godhead. In the Vedas it is said, bh&#299;sh&#257;sm&#257;d v&#257;tah pavate/ bh&#299;shodeti s&#363;ryah: "Out of fear of the Supreme Lord, the wind-god and the sun-god are acting." Bh&#299;sh&#257;sm&#257;d agni&#347; candra&#347; ca/ mrityur dh&#257;vati pañcamah: "Agni, Indra and Mrityu are also acting under His direction." These are the statements of the Vedas.</P><P>If the demigods are subject to fear, what of ordinary living entities? Material life is not very happy because we are always fearful of something. No one can say, "I am not afraid of anything." Everyone is afraid of something. There is not a bird, beast, human being or living entity alive that is not afraid of something. This is because we are absorbed in the bodily conception, thinking, "I am this body." Since everyone is thinking in this way, everyone fears bodily destruction. When there was an earthquake in Los Angeles, everyone ran out their houses screaming. Everyone was terrified, thinking, "Now death is coming!" This is material nature. There are many events in nature that cause fear. There are great cyclones and tornadoes. There is excessive heat and excessive rain. There is flood and famine and war. Yet people are thinking of being happy on this planet.</P><P>Modern scientists say that there are no demigods and that there is no God, that all events are being carried out by nature. It is true that nature is working, but nature, after all, is nothing but matter. Matter cannot work without being directed by a living being. We cannot say that matter works independently. In the ocean we always see that there are great waves moving. Water is dull matter, but the air is pushing these great waves and dashing them onto the earth. Scientists say that nature works in this way and that, but nature is not independent. We receive information from authoritative &#347;&#257;stras that nature is moving under the direction of the demigods. So we cannot say that these processes are automatically taking place. Scientists admit that nature is working in a wonderful way, but, after all, nature is not under their control. The scientists may accept or defy Krishna, but they cannot defy the activities of nature. Everyone is subordinate to nature. Nature, however, is working under the direction of God; therefore everyone is subordinate to God.</P><P>The sun, oceans, land, space and everything else in material creation are but manifestations of Krishna's external energy. Nothing is independent of Krishna or His energy. In Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bs/5/44.htm">5.44</A>) it is said that material nature is so powerful that it can create, maintain and destroy in itself: Srishti-sthiti-pralaya-s&#257;dhana-&#347;aktir ek&#257;. However, material nature is working just like a shadow. If we place our hand before a light, we can see its shadow move on a wall. Similarly, material nature is working due to the touch of spirit soul. It is not possible for an automobile to drive itself. A person, a spirit soul, must be within to push certain buttons. Due to the touch of the spirit soul, the machine is moving. The entire universe is similarly moving due to the touch of God. According to the &#347;&#257;stras, the wind is blowing, the water is moving, the sun is shining and the earth is revolving under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If the directors of the different material elements do not work properly, they are punished by their master, Krishna.</P><P>When Krishna was present on this earth, He saw that Lord Indra, the lord of the heavens and of rain, was somewhat puffed up. Krishna therefore advised His father Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja not to bother worshiping Indra. He told His father, "There is no need to offer sacrifices to Indra. It is better to worship Govardhana Hill, which is the representative of God. The cows receive their grass and grains from Govardhana Hill; therefore it is better to worship it." At first, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was not willing to do this, but out of affection for Krishna, he finally agreed. When Indra saw that Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was worshiping Govardhana Hill, he became very angry and sent vicious clouds to inundate all of Vrind&#257;vana with a flood. Krishna then showed Indra that his power was not even competent to deal with the little finger of His left hand. Therefore Krishna lifted Govardhana Hill with the small finger of His left hand and used it as an umbrella to save all the people of Vrind&#257;vana from Indra's torrents. All of this is related in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</P><P>Thus everyone is a servant. No one can actually claim to be master. If we simply take shelter of Krishna, we do not have to offer sacrifices to various demigods. If we water the root of a tree, we do not have to water the branches, twigs, flowers or fruits. If we supply food to the stomach, we do not have to feed the eyes, hands and legs separately. Similarly, if we worship Krishna, the source of everything, no other worship is necessary.</P><P>Large amounts of wealth are necessary to perform sacrifices. In former ages, tons of food were offered in a fire as a sacrifice, but this is not possible in this age. Therefore sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-yajña, the chanting of the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra, is recommended. Anyone can chant Hare Krishna. There is no need for instruments, although Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu introduced the mrida&#324;ga (drum) and karat&#257;las (cymbals). Otherwise, clapping in itself is sufficient. Anyone can sit down with his family, clap hands and chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare. This sa&#324;k&#299;rtana is very easy to perform. In the evening people go to restaurants and cinemas and waste time and money at clubs and dances. They are not aware of the fearful situation of birth, old age, disease and death. People are carried away by the waves of material nature, and they have submitted to its laws. We should not waste our time in this valuable human form but should begin to solve our problems.</P><P>Eventually everything on this earth will be annihilated. At present, three fourths of this earth is covered with water. In the beginning, the entire earth was covered with water, but gradually the water is drying up, and more land is emerging. Since the land has emerged, we have calculated that this is the Asian continent, this is North America, South America, Africa and so on. Eventually there will be no water but only land, and this means that there will ultimately be destruction. Since there will be no water, the heat will be scorching, and eventually the earth will be burned to ashes. Then again there will be rainfall, and everything will be mixed up again, and again there will be destruction. In this way things come into existence and are dissolved. Similarly, this body comes into existence, takes a nice form, and then is finally finished forever. We will then have to get another body. The body is like a bubble. It is present for one moment, then it bursts and is gone forever.</P><P>We simply take on one bubble after another, one body after another, and we think that we will become happy in this way because we are so foolish. Krishna comes as a person like us, but we are such rascals that we think He is simply a man, and this is our misfortune. If we just surrender unto Krishna, we will no longer be subjected to the karma of different bodies. Even if we attempt to render some devotional service to Him and fall down, we lose nothing and gain everything. A human life is guaranteed in our next birth. It is therefore to our benefit to accept Krishna.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.krishna.com"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
