Self-realization is the position of the liberated state. One understands his constitutional position by knowledge and vair&#257;gya, renunciation. Without knowledge, one cannot have realization. The realization that one is the infinitesimal part and parcel of the Supreme Spirit makes one unattached to material, conditional life. That is the beginning of devotional service. Unless one is liberated from material contamination, one cannot engage in the devotional service of the Lord. In this verse, therefore, it is stated, jñ&#257;na-vair&#257;gya-yuktena: when one is in full knowledge of one's constitutional position and is in the renounced order of life, detached from material attraction, then, by pure devotional service, bhakti-yuktena, he can engage himself as a loving servant of the Lord. paripa&#347;yati means that he can see everything in its right perspective. Then the influence of material nature becomes almost nil. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. Brahma-bh&#363;tah prasann&#257;tm&#257;: [<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/18/54.htm">Bg. 18.54</A>] when one is self-realized he becomes happy and free from the influence of material nature, and at that time he is freed from lamentation and hankering. The Lord states that position as mad-bhaktim labhate par&#257;m [<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/18/54.htm">Bg. 18.54</A>], the real beginning of devotional service. Similarly, it is confirmed in the N&#257;rada-pañcar&#257;tra that when the senses are purified, they can then be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. One who is attached to material contamination cannot be a devotee.</P><P>In the conditional state, we are influenced by material nature. We have already discussed how we are conditioned by the three modes of material nature&#8212;ignorance, passion and goodness. Goodness is superior to ignorance and passion because from the platform of goodness we can come to understand Krishna and thereby transcend the modes altogether. In this age, people are generally influenced by the lower modes, the modes of ignorance and passion. In these modes, we are not able to serve Krishna. It is our constitutional position to serve someone, but when we do not serve Krishna, we serve m&#257;y&#257;. In any case, we cannot become master. Who can say that he is a master, that he is not serving anyone? We may serve our family, society, country, business, automobile or whatever. If one cannot find anything to serve, he goes and buys a cat or dog and serves it. Why is this? It is because service is our nature. We are simply lacking the knowledge of where to direct the service. Service is meant to be rendered to Krishna. In the material world we are serving our lusty desires, not Krishna, and we are deriving no pleasure from this. We are also serving in an office or in some employment in order to get some money. In this case, we are serving money, not the person. Thus in the material world we serve the senses and money. In any case, service is there. We must serve.</P><P>Actually the only master is Krishna. Ekale &#299;&#347;vara krishna, &#257;ra saba bhritya (Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../cc/adi/5/142.htm">&#256;di 5.142</A>). All the demigods, human beings, animals, trees and everything else are servants. Self-realization is realizing that one is the eternal servant of Krishna and that one's duty is to serve Him. Self-realization is not thinking aham brahm&#257;smi, "I have become Brahman, Bhagav&#257;n." How can we become Bhagav&#257;n? If we are Bhagav&#257;n, we are actually the supreme powerful one. If this is the case, why are we in a miserable condition? Why are we under the influence of m&#257;y&#257;? Does Bhagav&#257;n come under the influence of m&#257;y&#257;? No. Krishna says specifically in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; that prakriti, m&#257;y&#257;, is working under His directions. M&#257;y&#257; is the maidservant of Krishna, and if we are the servants of ma-ya-, how can we be Krishna, Bhagav&#257;n? When we come to our spiritual senses, we can understand that we are erroneously engaged in m&#257;y&#257;'s service and that our duty is to engage in Krishna's service. That is self-realization. As stated here: jñ&#257;na-vair&#257;gya-yuktena. Real understanding is knowing oneself to be the servant of Krishna, no one else. Because we are under illusion, we are serving k&#257;ma, lobha, moha, m&#257;tsarya&#8212;lust and greed&#8212;without benefit and without pleasure. K&#257;m&#257;d&#299;n&#257;m kati na katidh&#257; p&#257;lit&#257; durnide&#347;&#257;: "There is no limit to the unwanted orders of lusty desires." (Bhakti-ras&#257;mrita-sindhu <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/brs3/2/25">3.2.25</A>) When we come to the understanding that our pleasure lies in serving Krishna only, we have attained jñ&#257;na-vair&#257;gya. Therefore in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../sb/1/2/7.htm">1.2.7</A>) it is stated:</P><P>v&#257;sudeve bhagavati</P><P CLASS=n>bhakti-yogah prayojitah</P><P CLASS=n>janayaty &#257;&#347;u vair&#257;gyam</P><P CLASS=n>jñ&#257;nam ca yad ahaitukam</P><P>"By rendering devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; Krishna, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world." If one engages in the service of V&#257;sudeva, Krishna, this knowledge comes, and one becomes a mah&#257;tm&#257;. A mah&#257;tm&#257; is one who realizes that Krishna is everything. He does not defy Krishna or try to become Krishna. One who does so is not a mah&#257;tm&#257; but a dur&#257;tm&#257;, a rascal. What is the position and knowledge of a mah&#257;tm&#257;? Krishna states:</P><P>mah&#257;tm&#257;nas tu m&#257;m p&#257;rtha</P><P CLASS=n>daiv&#299;m prakritim &#257;&#347;rit&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>bhajanty ananya-manaso</P><P CLASS=n>jñ&#257;tv&#257; bh&#363;t&#257;dim avyayam</P><P>"O son of Prith&#257;, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/9/13.htm">Bg. 9.13</A>)</P><P>A mah&#257;tm&#257; cannot be manufactured. He is under the daiv&#299; prakriti, the divine nature. There are two kinds of prakriti&#8212;par&#257; prakriti and apar&#257; prakriti. Apar&#257; prakriti is the material world, and daiv&#299; prakriti is the spiritual world. As soon as one understands that he is uselessly serving m&#257;y&#257; in the material world in the form of society, friends, country and so forth, one reaches the stage called jñ&#257;na, knowledge. As soon as one attains this knowledge, he reaches the brahma-bh&#363;ta stage, Brahman realization, and he becomes prasann&#257;tm&#257;, happy. One may ask, "Why should I serve Krishna?" We have already explained that being a part means serving the whole. The whole is Krishna, and the individuals are meant for Krishna's satisfaction. &#298;&#347;&#257;v&#257;syam idam sarvam.</P><P>There are many &#299;&#347;varas, controllers, but the supreme &#299;&#347;vara is Krishna. As soon as one attains this realization, he has attained perfect knowledge, and he renders service in bhakti-yoga. Foolish people say that bhakti is meant for ajñan&#299;s, unintelligent people, but this is not the case. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; Krishna indicates that after many births, the jñ&#257;n&#299;, the man in knowledge, surrenders unto Him.</P><P>As long as we do not understand Krishna, V&#257;sudeva, we should understand that we are still fools. We may advertise ourselves as very great jñ&#257;n&#299;s, learned personalities, but we are actually fools. That is the &#347;&#257;stric conclusion. If we are actually jñ&#257;n&#299;s, we should surrender unto Krishna.</P><P>There are many dharmas, or activities. Some are pious and some impious, but Krishna tells us to give up both. Arjuna was thinking that it was impious to fight with his relatives, but Krishna was insisting that he fight. How could Arjuna act impiously? He could not, because Krishna's service is transcendental to pious and impious activity. At midnight, when the gop&#299;s heard the sound of Krishna's flute, they ran to the forest to join Him. According to the &#347;&#257;stras, it is immoral for young girls to go see a young boy in a forest in the dead of night. But this was not an impious activity because the gop&#299;s did this for Krishna. Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, who was so strict that no woman could even come near Him to offer respects, actually said: ramy&#257; k&#257;cid up&#257;san&#257; vraja-vadh&#363;-vargena y&#257; kalpit&#257;. "What could be more wonderful than that worship conceived by the gop&#299;s?" Although it actually appeared immoral for the gop&#299;s to dance with Krishna, Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu states that their relation with Krishna is the highest</P><P>form of worship. This is actually transcendental knowledge. One becomes transcendental to all pious and impious activities when one serves Krishna. After all, piety and impiety are within the material modes. Krishna's service is transcendental to good and bad, pious and impious. Bhakti-yoga begins when jñ&#257;na and vair&#257;gya are complete. Jñ&#257;na is knowledge, and vair&#257;gya is detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Both of these are automatically attained when we engage in devotional service to Krishna.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.krishna.com"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
