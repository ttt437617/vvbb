Unless one has good engagements in spiritual service, it is not possible to become detached from material service. Those who are not devotees, therefore, are interested in so-called humanitarian or philanthropic work, such as opening a hospital or charitable institution. These are undoubtedly good works in the sense that they are pious activities, and the performer may get some opportunities for sense gratification, either in this life or in the next. Devotional service, however, is beyond the boundary of sense gratification. It is a completely spiritual activity. When one engages in the spiritual activities of devotional service, he does not engage in sense gratificatory activities. Krishna conscious activities are performed not blindly but with the perfect understanding of knowledge and renunciation. This kind of yoga practice, in which the mind is always fixed upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotion, results in liberation in this very life. The person who performs such acts gets in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Caitanya, therefore, approved the process of hearing from realized devotees about the pastimes of the Lord. It does not matter to what mundane category the audience belongs. If one meekly and submissively hears about the activities of the Lord from a realized soul, he will be able to conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unconquerable by any other process. Hearing and associating with devotees are the most important functions for self-realization.</P><P>In Goloka Vrind&#257;vana, the living entities are serving Krishna as friends, cowherd boys, gop&#299;s, lovers, fathers, mothers and so on. Even the trees, water, flowers, land, calves and cows serve Krishna in Goloka Vrind&#257;vana. This is also our business, but somehow or other we do not like to serve Krishna; therefore we have been put into the service of m&#257;y&#257;, in the three modes of material nature. When a criminal does not like to obey the laws of the state, he is placed into prison and forced to abide by the laws. Our constitutional position is to render service to Krishna as His part and parcel, and as soon as we refuse to render Him service, m&#257;y&#257; is immediately there to capture us and say, "Serve me." It is not our nature to become master. Even if we become master, we will not be happy, because that is artificial. For instance, if the hand thinks, "Oh, now I have some nice sweets. Now I can eat," the hand will ultimately be frustrated. It is the duty and nature of the hand to place the food in the mouth. In this way the hand is nourished; otherwise everything is spoiled. Similarly, we are part and parcel of Krishna, and our business is to satisfy Krishna. From the Vedas we understand that Cod, who is one, has become many. We are the many parts and parcels of Krishna. Sv&#257;m&#347;as are His personal expansions, and we are His differential expansions, vibhinn&#257;m&#347;as. In any case, all expansions are meant to serve Krishna. This is explained in the Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita (<A CLASS=v HREF="../cc/adi/5/142.htm">&#256;di 5.142</A>): ekale &#299;&#347;vara krishna, &#257;ra saba bhritya. "Lord Krishna alone is the supreme controller, and all others are His servants."</P><P>It is our natural propensity to enjoy ourselves with Krishna. As stated before, Krishna is &#257;nanda-maya, and, being part and parcel of Krishna, we are also &#257;nanda-maya. Now we are seeking &#257;nanda (bliss) in different atmospheres. Because we have a little independence, we have decided to go to the prison house of material nature and try to serve our senses instead of Krishna. Now we have to learn how to forget to serve this material nature, and that process is bhakti-m&#257;rga, the path of devotional service. When we come to the understanding that we are actually no one's servant but Krishna's, we attain self-realization. We must come to this understanding not by sentiment but by real knowledge. After many births and deaths, when one realizes that v&#257;sudevah sarvam iti [<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/7/19.htm">Bg. 7.19</A>]&#8212;V&#257;sudeva is all&#8212;he surrenders unto Krishna. This is real knowledge&#8212;jñ&#257;na and vair&#257;gya, knowledge and detachment from material things.</P><P>Once one engages fully in Krishna's service, he comes to the brahma-bh&#363;ta platform. Presently we are on the m&#257;y&#257;-bh&#363;ta platform, identifying ourselves with m&#257;y&#257; and working according to the modes of material nature. However, when one comes to the realization that he is spirit (aham brahm&#257;smi), he will immediately become happy.</P><P>Under the modes of material nature, we are being carried away by the waves of material nature, and we have no control over where we are going. Bhaktivinoda Th&#257;kura has stated: m&#257;y&#257;ra va&#347;e, y&#257;ccha bhese', kh&#257;ccha h&#257;budubu, bh&#257;i. We are like straws on the waves of the ocean, and we are fully under the control of the waves. Atheists shudder when they think that there is a next life, because their lives are sinful and they fear punishment in the next. There is a Bengali proverb about a person who thought, "I have committed so many sinful acts that Yamar&#257;ja will come and punish me. How can I avoid him?" Thinking about this some time, he decided, "Let me smear my body with stool. Then Yamar&#257;ja will not touch me." However, this is simply foolishness. We are under the control of m&#257;y&#257;, material nature, and it is not possible to avoid it. We have become infected by the disease of material nature, and no artificial means will save us. There is no way out other than surrender to Krishna. Krishna says that He will save us, even though we are very sinful.</P><P>If we turn our attention to Krishna's service, to bhakti-yoga, we can force ourselves to give up all anarthas, unwanted things. We should get up early in the morning and engage ourselves in the service of Krishna; then gradually we will forget the service of m&#257;y&#257;. Bhakti-yoga is so strong that if we engage in it, m&#257;y&#257;'s service will automatically be negated. This is called vair&#257;gya.</P><P>Krishna is the original purusha, the original spirit, the original person. Everything has come from Krishna, and therefore He is Pur&#257;na, the oldest. No one is older than Krishna, but He is always young. That is Bhagav&#257;n. He is &#257;di, the original source, the cause of all causes. Yet we never see Krishna as an old man. He is always fresh and youthful. Although Krishna was a great-grandfather at the Battle of Kurukshetra, He did not appear any older than a young man of twenty. Krishna is always a young boy, and those living entities in the spiritual universe also have spiritual bodies the same as Krishna's. In the Sixth Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam we read that when the Vaikuntha-d&#363;tas came to take Aj&#257;mila, they were four-handed and very beautiful. In the spiritual world, there are four-handed living entities, and they are all nitya-mukta, eternally liberated.</P><P>Unfortunately, we are now prisoners in this material world, and we presently have material bodies. These bodies are changing. Sometimes they are young and sometimes old. However, if we become Krishna conscious, we will not get another material body after leaving this body. We will go home, back to Godhead, and attain our original, spiritual body, which is the same kind of beautiful body that Krishna, N&#257;r&#257;yana, has. We should take this opportunity to become devotees of Krishna by following the processes of bhakti-yoga&#8212;&#347;ravanam k&#299;rtanam vishnoh smaranam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../sb/7/5/23.htm">SB 7.5.23</A>]. p&#257;da-sevanam arcanam. We can take one or all of the nine processes of devotional service and make our lives successful. Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has prescribed the most important process&#8212;&#347;ravanam. We need only hear, and that will make our lives successful.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.krishna.com"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
