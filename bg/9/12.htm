In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in Krishna consciousness and devotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, as the Absolute Truth. For them, the fruit of devotional service &#8212; going back to Godhead &#8212; will never be tasted. Similarly, those who are engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either, because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna. In other words, persons who mock Krishna are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, such demonic miscreants never surrender to Krishna. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and Krishna are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to become one with Krishna will be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra and the Upanishads. is always baffled.</P><P>It is a great offense, therefore, to consider Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded because they cannot understand the eternal form of Krishna. The Brihad-vishnu-smriti clearly states:</P><P>yo vetti bhautikam deham</P><P CLASS=n>krishnasya param&#257;tmanah</P><P CLASS=n>sa sarvasm&#257;d bahish-k&#257;ryah</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;rauta-sm&#257;rta-vidh&#257;natah</P><P CLASS=n>mukham tasy&#257;valoky&#257;pi</P><P CLASS=n>sa-celam sn&#257;nam &#257;caret</P><P>"One who considers the body of Krishna to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the &#347;ruti and the smriti. And if one by chance sees his face, one should at once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself of infection. People jeer at Krishna because they are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac life. Perpetually, their real knowledge will remain under delusion, and gradually they will regress to the darkest region of creation."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
