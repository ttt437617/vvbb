They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being, is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider Krishna to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-samhit&#257; (&#299;&#347;varah paramah krishnah); He is the Supreme Lord.</P><P>There are many &#299;&#347;varas, controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another. In the Brahma-samhit&#257; it is said that Krishna is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly, both in the material and spiritual world, but Krishna is the supreme controller (&#299;&#347;varah paramah krishnah). and His body is sac-cid-&#257;nanda, nonmaterial.</P><P>Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called here m&#257;nush&#299;m because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna's, a politician involved in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>] &#8212; eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed in the Vedic language also. Sac-cid-&#257;nanda-r&#363;p&#257;ya krishn&#257;ya: "I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge." (Gop&#257;la-t&#257;pan&#299; Upanishad <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/1/1">1.1</A>) There are other descriptions in the Vedic language also. Tam ekam govindam: "You are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows." Sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraham: "And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality." (Gop&#257;la-t&#257;pan&#299; Upanishad <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/1/35">1.35</A>)</P><P>Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord Krishna's body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; who deride Krishna as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of &#346;r&#299; Krishna is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called m&#363;dha. for only foolish persons consider Krishna to be an ordinary human being. The foolish consider Krishna an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know that Krishna's body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because they do not know that Krishna has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.</P><P>Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master of the material energy. As has been explained in several places (mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to Krishna can get out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body like us? So this conception of Krishna is complete foolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, Krishna, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His yogam ai&#347;varam, His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how Krishna, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in Krishna consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.</P><P>There are many controversies between the impersonalists and the personalists about the Lord's appearance as a human being. But if we consult Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; and &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, the authoritative texts for understanding the science of Krishna, then we can understand that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages headed by &#346;aunaka inquired about the activities of Krishna, they said:</P><P>kritav&#257;n kila karm&#257;ni</P><P CLASS=n>saha r&#257;mena ke&#347;avah</P><P CLASS=n>ati-marty&#257;ni bhagav&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>g&#363;dhah kapata-m&#257;nushah</P><P>"Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with Balar&#257;ma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../sb/1/1/20.htm">1.1.20</A>) The Lord's appearance as a man bewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that Krishna performed while He was present on this earth. When Krishna appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devak&#299;, He appeared with four hands, but after the prayers of the parents He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. As stated in the Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../sb/10/3/46.htm">10.3.46</A>), babh&#363;va pr&#257;kritah &#347;i&#347;uh: He became just like an ordinary child, an ordinary human being. Now, here again it is indicated that the Lord's appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see Krishna's form of four hands (tenaiva r&#363;pena catur-bhujena). After revealing this form, Krishna, when petitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form (m&#257;nusham r&#363;pam). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being.</P><P>Some of those who deride Krishna and who are infected with the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophy quote the following verse from the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../sb/3/29/21.htm">3.29.21</A>) to prove that Krishna is just an ordinary man. Aham sarveshu bh&#363;teshu bh&#363;t&#257;tm&#257;vasthitah sad&#257;: "The Supreme is present in every living entity." We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vaishnava &#257;c&#257;ryas like J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; and Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride Krishna. J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, commenting on this verse, says that Krishna, in His plenary expansion as Param&#257;tm&#257;, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the arc&#257;-m&#363;rti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that because Krishna is present in everyone's heart as Param&#257;tm&#257;, every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in which the Param&#257;tm&#257; dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.</P><P>There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in Krishna consciousness knows that although Krishna is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as confirmed in the Brahma-samhit&#257;. Although His personal abode is Goloka Vrind&#257;vana and He is always staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
