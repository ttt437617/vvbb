Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in Krishna consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in Krishna consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in Krishna consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent, whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no profit. Aj&#257;mila performed his duty in some percentage of Krishna consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord. There is a nice verse in this connection in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../sb/1/5/17.htm">1.5.17</A>):</P><P>tyaktv&#257; sva-dharmam caran&#257;mbujam harer</P><P CLASS=n>bhajann apakvo 'tha patet tato yadi</P><P CLASS=n>yatra kva v&#257;bhadram abh&#363;d amushya kim</P><P CLASS=n>ko v&#257;rtha &#257;pto 'bhajat&#257;m sva-dharmatah</P><P>"If someone gives up his occupational duties and works in Krishna consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly?" Or, as the Christians say, "What profiteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul?"</P><P>Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in Krishna consciousness carries a person again to Krishna consciousness, even after the loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured br&#257;hmana or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in Krishna consciousness.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
