Although the person in full Krishna consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his being Krishna conscious he has no attachment to sensual activities. The Krishna conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of Krishna, and nothing else. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment and detachment. If Krishna wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if Krishna does not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of Krishna. This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual platform.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="63.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="65.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
