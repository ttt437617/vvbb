Even Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra, a great sage and perfect yog&#299;, was misled by Menak&#257; into sex enjoyment, although the yog&#299; was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice. And, of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind and senses without being fully Krishna conscious. Without engaging the mind in Krishna, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given by &#346;r&#299; Y&#257;mun&#257;c&#257;rya, a great saint and devotee, who says:</P><P>yad-avadhi mama cetah krishna-p&#257;d&#257;ravinde</P><P CLASS=n>nava-nava-rasa-dh&#257;many udyatam rantum &#257;s&#299;t</P><P CLASS=n>tad-avadhi bata n&#257;r&#299;-sa&#324;game smaryam&#257;ne</P><P CLASS=n>bhavati mukha-vik&#257;rah sushthu nishth&#299;vanam ca</P><P>"Since my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, and I have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought."</P><P>Krishna consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha also conquered a great yog&#299;, Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, simply because his mind was engaged in Krishna consciousness (sa vai manah krishna-p&#257;d&#257;ravindayor vac&#257;msi vaikuntha-gun&#257;nuvarnane).</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="59.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="61.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
