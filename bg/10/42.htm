With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to Krishna's entering them as Supersoul. From Brahm&#257;, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them.</P><P>There is a Mission that regularly propounds that worship of any demigod will lead one to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the supreme goal. But worship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva represent only part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is asamaurdhva, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In the Padma Pur&#257;na it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord Krishna in the same category with demigods &#8212; be they even Brahm&#257; or &#346;iva &#8212; becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of Krishna's energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna and can fix his mind in the worship of Krishna without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in Krishna consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship of Krishna are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight through eleven. That is the way of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter. &#346;r&#299;la Baladeva Vidy&#257;bh&#363;shana, a great &#257;c&#257;rya in disciplic succession from Krishna, concludes his commentary on this chapter by saying,</P><P>yac-chakti-le&#347;&#257;t sury&#257;dy&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>bhavanty aty-ugra-tejasah</P><P CLASS=n>yad-am&#347;ena dhritam vi&#347;vam</P><P CLASS=n>sa krishno da&#347;ame 'rcyate</P><P>From Lord Krishna's potent energy even the powerful sun gets its power, and by Krishna's partial expansion the whole world is maintained. Therefore Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna is worshipable.</P><P>Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the &#346;r&#299;mad Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; in the matter of the Opulence of the Absolute.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="../11/1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
