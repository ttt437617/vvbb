Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually Krishna consciousness. The person acting in Krishna consciousness is really a sanny&#257;s&#299;, one in the renounced order of life. By such a mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. A sanny&#257;s&#299; is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in Krishna consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This state of mind is called yog&#257;r&#363;dha, or the perfectional stage of yoga. As confirmed in the Third Chapter, yas tv &#257;tma-ratir eva sy&#257;t: one who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his activity.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
