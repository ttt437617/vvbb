The Eighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before. In every chapter of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, Lord Krishna stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service: yogin&#257;m api sarvesh&#257;m. .. "Of all yog&#299;s or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best." In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, represented by the words om tat sat, which indicate Vishnu, the Supreme Person. The third part of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; has shown that devotional service, and nothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing past &#257;c&#257;ryas and the Brahma-s&#363;tra, the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra. Certain impersonalists consider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge of Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra, but actually the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</P><P>As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, namely renunciation (ty&#257;ga) and the renounced order of life (sanny&#257;sa). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words.</P><P>Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord &#8212; Hrish&#299;ke&#347;a and Ke&#347;&#299;-nish&#363;dana &#8212; are significant. Hrish&#299;ke&#347;a is Krishna, the master of all senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equipoised. Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses Krishna as Ke&#347;&#299;-nish&#363;dana. Ke&#347;&#299; was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting Krishna to kill the demon of doubt.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../17/28.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
