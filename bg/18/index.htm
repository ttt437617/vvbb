And giving up the results of all activities is what the wise call renunciation [ty&#257;ga].</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>BG 18.3</B></A>: Some learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activities should be given up as faulty, yet other sages maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity and penance should never be abandoned.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>BG 18.4</B></A>: O best of the Bh&#257;ratas, now hear My judgment about renunciation.

Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>BG 18.6</B></A>: All these activities should be performed without attachment or any expectation of result. They should be performed as a matter of duty, O son of Prith&#257;. That is My final opinion.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>BG 18.7</B></A>: Prescribed duties should never be renounced. If one gives up his prescribed duties because of illusion, such renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>BG 18.8</B></A>: Anyone who gives up prescribed duties as troublesome or out of fear of bodily discomfort is said to have renounced in the mode of passion. Such action never leads to the elevation of renunciation.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>BG 18.9</B></A>: O Arjuna, when one performs his prescribed duty only because it ought to be done, and renounces all material association and all attachment to the fruit, his renunciation is said to be in the mode of goodness.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>BG 18.10</B></A>: The intelligent renouncer situated in the mode of goodness, neither hateful of inauspicious work nor attached to auspicious work, has no doubts about work.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>BG 18.11</B></A>: It is indeed impossible for an embodied being to give up all activities.

such unintelligent determination, O son of Prith&#257;, is in the mode of darkness.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>BG 18.36</B></A>: O best of the Bh&#257;ratas, now please hear from Me about the three kinds of happiness by which the conditioned soul enjoys, and by which he sometimes comes to the end of all distress.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>BG 18.37</B></A>: That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm"><B>BG 18.38</B></A>: That happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects and which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is said to be of the nature of passion.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm"><B>BG 18.39</B></A>: And that happiness which is blind to self-realization, which is delusion from beginning to end and which arises from sleep, laziness and illusion is said to be of the nature of ignorance.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm"><B>BG 18.40</B></A>: There is no being existing, either here or among the demigods in the higher planetary systems, which is freed from these three modes born of material nature.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm"><B>BG 18.41</B></A>: Br&#257;hmanas, kshatriyas, vai&#347;yas and &#347;&#363;dras are distinguished by the qualities born of their own natures in accordance with the material modes, O chastiser of the enemy.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm"><B>BG 18.42</B></A>: Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, knowledge, wisdom and religiousness &#8212;
