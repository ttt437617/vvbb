There are no material reactions resulting from the activities of a Krishna conscious person. Therefore purified activities, which are generally called sad-&#257;c&#257;ra, can be easily performed by acting in Krishna consciousness. &#346;r&#299; R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; in his Bhakti-ras&#257;mrita-sindhu (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/brs1/2/187">1.2.187</A>) describes this as follows:</P><P>&#299;h&#257; yasya harer d&#257;sye</P><P CLASS=n>karman&#257; manas&#257; gir&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>nikhil&#257;sv apy avasth&#257;su</P><P CLASS=n>j&#299;van-muktah sa ucyate</P><P>"A person acting in Krishna consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of Krishna) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities." He has no false ego, for he does not believe that he is this material body, or that he possesses the body. He knows that he is not this body and that this body does not belong to him. He himself belongs to Krishna, and the body too belongs to Krishna. When he applies everything produced of the body, mind, intelligence, words, life, wealth, etc. &#8212; whatever he may have within his possession &#8212; to Krishna's service, he is at once dovetailed with Krishna. He is one with Krishna and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe that he is the body, etc. This is the perfect stage of Krishna consciousness.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
