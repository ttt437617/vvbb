This being known, nothing further shall remain for you to know.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>BG 7.3</B></A>: Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>BG 7.4</B></A>: Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego &#8212; all together these eight constitute My separated material energies.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>BG 7.5</B></A>: Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>BG 7.6</B></A>: All created beings have their source in these two natures.
