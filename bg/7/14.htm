But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy their original superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows: m&#257;y&#257;m tu prakritim vidy&#257;n m&#257;yinam tu mahe&#347;varam. "Although m&#257;y&#257; [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of m&#257;y&#257; is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahe&#347;vara, the supreme controller." (&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upanishad <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/4/10">4.10</A>)</P><P>Another meaning of guna is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself &#8212; he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord Krishna, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or Krishna consciousness, can help one gain such release. Krishna, being the Lord of illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity, who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature.</P><P>The words m&#257;m eva are also significant. M&#257;m means unto Krishna (Vishnu) only, and not Brahm&#257; or &#346;iva. Although Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Vishnu, it is not possible for such incarnations of rajo-guna (passion) and tamo-guna (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of m&#257;y&#257;. In other words, both Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva are also under the influence of m&#257;y&#257;. Only Vishnu is the master of m&#257;y&#257;; therefore He alone can give release to the conditioned soul. The Vedas (&#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upanishad <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/3/8">3.8</A>) confirm this in the phrase tam eva viditv&#257;. or "Freedom is possible only by understanding Krishna." Even Lord &#346;iva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Vishnu. Lord &#346;iva says, mukti-prad&#257;t&#257; sarvesh&#257;m vishnur eva na sam&#347;ayah: "There is no doubt that Vishnu is the deliverer of liberation for everyone."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
