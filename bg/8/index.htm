What is the self? What are fruitive activities? What is this material manifestation? And what are the demigods? Please explain this to me.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>BG 8.2</B></A>: Who is the Lord of sacrifice, and how does He live in the body, O Madhus&#363;dana? And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at the time of death?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>BG 8.3</B></A>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The indestructible, transcendental living entity is called Brahman, and his eternal nature is called adhy&#257;tma, the self. Action pertaining to the development of the material bodies of the living entities is called karma, or fruitive activities.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>BG 8.4</B></A>: O best of the embodied beings, the physical nature, which is constantly changing, is called adhibh&#363;ta [the material manifestation]. The universal form of the Lord, which includes all the demigods, like those of the sun and moon, is called adhidaiva. And I, the Supreme Lord, represented as the Supersoul in the heart of every embodied being, am called adhiyajña [the Lord of sacrifice].</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>BG 8.5</B></A>: And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>BG 8.6</B></A>: Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kunt&#299;, that state he will attain without fail.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>BG 8.7</B></A>: Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Krishna and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting. With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me without doubt.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>BG 8.8</B></A>: He who meditates on Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O P&#257;rtha, is sure to reach Me.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>BG 8.9</B></A>: One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who is inconceivable, and who is always a person. He is luminous like the sun, and He is transcendental, beyond this material nature.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>BG 8.10</B></A>: One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and, by the strength of yoga, with an undeviating mind, engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord in full devotion, will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>BG 8.11</B></A>: Persons who are learned in the Vedas, who utter omk&#257;ra and who are great sages in the renounced order enter into Brahman.

I shall now briefly explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>BG 8.12</B></A>: The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>BG 8.13</B></A>: After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>BG 8.14</B></A>: For one who always remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of Prith&#257;, because of his constant engagement in devotional service.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>BG 8.15</B></A>: After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yog&#299;s in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>BG 8.16</B></A>: From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kunt&#299;, never takes birth again.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>BG 8.17</B></A>: By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together form the duration of Brahm&#257;'s one day. And such also is the duration of his night.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>BG 8.18</B></A>: At the beginning of Brahm&#257;'s day, all living entities become manifest from the unmanifest state, and thereafter, when the night falls, they are merged into the unmanifest again.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>BG 8.19</B></A>: Again and again, when Brahm&#257;'s day arrives, all living entities come into being, and with the arrival of Brahm&#257;'s night they are helplessly annihilated.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>BG 8.20</B></A>: Yet there is another unmanifest nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>BG 8.21</B></A>: That which the Ved&#257;ntists describe as unmanifest and infallible, that which is known as the supreme destination, that place from which, having attained it, one never returns &#8212; that is My supreme abode.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>BG 8.22</B></A>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is greater than all, is attainable by unalloyed devotion. Although He is present in His abode, He is all-pervading, and everything is situated within Him.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>BG 8.23</B></A>: O best of the Bh&#257;ratas, I shall now explain to you the different times at which, passing away from this world, the yog&#299; does or does not come back.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>BG 8.24</B></A>: Those who know the Supreme Brahman attain that Supreme by passing away from the world during the influence of the fiery god, in the light, at an auspicious moment of the day, during the fortnight of the waxing moon, or during the six months when the sun travels in the north.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm"><B>BG 8.25</B></A>: The mystic who passes away from this world during the smoke, the night, the fortnight of the waning moon, or the six months when the sun passes to the south reaches the moon planet but again comes back.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>BG 8.26</B></A>: According to Vedic opinion, there are two ways of passing from this world &#8212; one in light and one in darkness. When one passes in light, he does not come back; but when one passes in darkness, he returns.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>BG 8.27</B></A>: Although the devotees know these two paths, O Arjuna, they are never bewildered. Therefore be always fixed in devotion.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>BG 8.28</B></A>: A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing austere sacrifices, giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. Simply by performing devotional service, he attains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
