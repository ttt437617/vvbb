I see in You no end, no middle and no beginning.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>BG 11.17</B></A>: Your form is difficult to see because of its glaring effulgence, spreading on all sides, like blazing fire or the immeasurable radiance of the sun. Yet I see this glowing form everywhere, adorned with various crowns, clubs and discs.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>BG 11.18</B></A>: You are the supreme primal objective. You are the ultimate resting place of all this universe. You are inexhaustible, and You are the oldest. You are the maintainer of the eternal religion, the Personality of Godhead. This is my opinion.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>BG 11.19</B></A>: You are without origin, middle or end. Your glory is unlimited.

Covering all the universe with Your effulgence, You are manifest with terrible, scorching rays.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>BG 11.31</B></A>: O Lord of lords, so fierce of form, please tell me who You are. I offer my obeisances unto You; please be gracious to me. You are the primal Lord. I want to know about You, for I do not know what Your mission is.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>BG 11.32</B></A>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Time I am, the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people.

He fearfully spoke to Lord Krishna in a faltering voice, as follows.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>BG 11.36</B></A>: Arjuna said: O master of the senses, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name, and thus everyone becomes attached to You. Although the perfected beings offer You their respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there. All this is rightly done.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>BG 11.37</B></A>: O great one, greater even than Brahm&#257;, You are the original creator. Why then should they not offer their respectful obeisances unto You? O limitless one, God of gods, refuge of the universe! You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm"><B>BG 11.38</B></A>: You are the original Personality of Godhead, the oldest, the ultimate sanctuary of this manifested cosmic world.

You are all-pervading, and thus You are everything!</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41-42.htm"><B>BG 11.41-42</B></A>: Thinking of You as my friend, I have rashly addressed You "O Krishna," "O Y&#257;dava," "O my friend," not knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love. I have dishonored You many times, jesting as we relaxed, lay on the same bed, or sat or ate together, sometimes alone and sometimes in front of many friends. O infallible one, please excuse me for all those offenses.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm"><B>BG 11.43</B></A>: You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, of the moving and the nonmoving. You are its worshipable chief, the supreme spiritual master. No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You.

Thus I fall down to offer You my respectful obeisances and ask Your mercy. As a father tolerates the impudence of his son, or a friend tolerates the impertinence of a friend, or a wife tolerates the familiarity of her partner, please tolerate the wrongs I may have done You.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm"><B>BG 11.45</B></A>: After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear.

I long to see You in that form.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm"><B>BG 11.47</B></A>: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, happily have I shown you, by My internal potency, this supreme universal form within the material world. No one before you has ever seen this primal form, unlimited and full of glaring effulgence.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm"><B>BG 11.48</B></A>: O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, nor by charity, nor by pious activities, nor by severe penances can I be seen in this form in the material world.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm"><B>BG 11.49</B></A>: You have been perturbed and bewildered by seeing this horrible feature of Mine.

Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form, which is so dear.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="53.htm"><B>BG 11.53</B></A>: The form you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood simply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, nor by charity, nor by worship. It is not by these means that one can see Me as I am.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="54.htm"><B>BG 11.54</B></A>: My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm"><B>BG 11.55</B></A>: My dear Arjuna, he who engages in My pure devotional service, free from the contaminations of fruitive activities and mental speculation, he who works for Me, who makes Me the supreme goal of his life, and who is friendly to every living being &#8212; he certainly comes to Me.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
