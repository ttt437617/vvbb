However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the Age of Kali. Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in Krishna consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in Krishna consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in Krishna consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sanny&#257;s&#299;, the perfect yogi.</P><P>The sanny&#257;s&#299;s sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yajñas (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is to become one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yog&#299; who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in Krishna consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A Krishna conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of Krishna, and thus he is the perfect sanny&#257;s&#299;, or perfect yog&#299;. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way:</P><P>na dhanam na janam na sundar&#299;m</P><P CLASS=n>kavit&#257;m v&#257; jagad-&#299;&#347;a k&#257;maye</P><P CLASS=n>mama janmani janman&#299;&#347;vare</P><P CLASS=n>bhavat&#257;d bhaktir ahaituk&#299; tvayi</P><P>"O Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful women.
