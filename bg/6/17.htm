As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept pras&#257;dam, sanctified food. Lord Krishna is offered, according to the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../9/26.htm">9.26</A>), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in Krishna consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a Krishna conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in Krishna consciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. Avyartha-k&#257;latvam: [Cc.<A CLASS=v HREF="../../cc/madhya/23/18.htm">Madhya 23.18-19</A>] a Krishna conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in this respect is &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who was always engaged in the service of Krishna and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that. Th&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa would not even accept pras&#257;dam nor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a Krishna conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with Krishna's interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in Krishna consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
