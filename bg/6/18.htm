A perfect yog&#299; is so well disciplined in the activities of the mind that he can no longer be disturbed by any kind of material desire. This perfectional stage can automatically be attained by persons in Krishna consciousness, as stated in the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../sb/9/4/18.htm">9.4.18-20</A>):</P><P>sa vai manah krishna-p&#257;d&#257;ravindayor</P><P CLASS=n>vac&#257;msi vaikuntha-gun&#257;nuvarnane</P><P CLASS=n>karau harer mandira-m&#257;rjan&#257;dishu</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;rutim cak&#257;r&#257;cyuta-sat-kathodaye</P><P CLASS=n>mukunda-li&#324;g&#257;laya-dar&#347;ane dri&#347;au</P><P CLASS=n>tad-bhritya-g&#257;tra-spar&#347;e '&#324;ga-sa&#324;gamam</P><P CLASS=n>ghr&#257;nam ca tat-p&#257;da-saroja-saurabhe</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;r&#299;mat-tulasy&#257; rasan&#257;m tad-arpite</P><P CLASS=n>p&#257;dau hareh kshetra-pad&#257;nusarpane</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;iro hrish&#299;ke&#347;a-pad&#257;bhivandane</P><P CLASS=n>k&#257;mam ca d&#257;sye na tu k&#257;ma-k&#257;myay&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>yathottama-&#347;loka-jan&#257;&#347;ray&#257; ratih</P><P>"King Ambar&#299;sha first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krishna; then, one after another, he engaged his words in describing the transcendental qualities of the Lord, his hands in mopping the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing of the activities of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the transcendental forms of the Lord, his body in touching the bodies of the devotees, his sense of smell in smelling the scents of the lotus flowers offered to the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulas&#299; leaf offered at the lotus feet of the Lord, his legs in going to places of pilgrimage and the temple of the Lord, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in executing the mission of the Lord. All these transcendental activities are quite befitting a pure devotee."</P><P>This transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers of the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person in Krishna consciousness, as is apparent in the above description of the engagements of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;sha. Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are called arcana, or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord. The senses and the mind require engagements. Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore, for people in general &#8212; especially those who are not in the renounced order of life &#8212; transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called yukta in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
