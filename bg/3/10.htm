All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Vishnu, or Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;: vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedyah. The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: patim vi&#347;vasy&#257;tme&#347;varam. Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu. In the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam also (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../sb/2/4/20.htm">2.4.20</A>) &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:</P><P>&#347;riyah patir yajña-patih praj&#257;-patir</P><P CLASS=n>dhiy&#257;m patir loka-patir dhar&#257;-patih</P><P CLASS=n>patir gati&#347; c&#257;ndhaka-vrishni-s&#257;tvat&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>pras&#299;dat&#257;m me bhagav&#257;n sat&#257;m patih</P><P>The praj&#257;-pati is Lord Vishnu, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this material world to enable the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yajñas (sacrifices) for the satisfaction of Vishnu, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety and after finishing the present material body they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of yajña, the conditioned souls gradually become Krishna conscious and become godly in all respects. In the Age of Kali, the sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-yajña (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-yajña and Krishna consciousness go well together. Lord Krishna in His devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../sb/11/5/32.htm">11.5.32</A>) as follows, with special reference to the sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-yajña:</P><P>krishna-varnam tvish&#257;krishnam</P><P CLASS=n>s&#257;&#324;gop&#257;&#324;g&#257;stra-p&#257;rshadam</P><P CLASS=n>yajñaih sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-pr&#257;yair</P><P CLASS=n>yajanti hi su-medhasah</P><P>"In this Age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-yajña." Other yajñas prescribed in the Vedic literatures are not easy to perform in this Age of Kali, but the sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-yajña is easy and sublime for all purposes, as recommended in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; also (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../sb/9/14.htm">9.14</A>).</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=360"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
