Why do You simply sit silently? It appears that You do have something to say about my explanations."</P><P>"My dear sir," the Lord replied. "As far as the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra or the codes of Ved&#257;nta are concerned, I can understand the meaning quite well. However, I cannot understand your explanations. There is nothing really difficult about the meaning of the original Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra, but the way you explain Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra appears to obscure the real meaning. You do not elucidate the direct meaning but imagine something and consequently obscure the true meaning. I think that you have a particular doctrine which you are trying to expound through the codes of Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra."</P><P>According to Muktika Upanishad, there are 108 Upanishads. Among these are: (1) &#298;&#347;a, (2) Kena, (3) Katha, (4) Pra&#347;na, (5) Mundaka, (6) M&#257;nd&#363;kya, (7) Tittiri, (8) Aitareya, (9) Ch&#257;ndogya, (10) Brihad-&#257;ranyaka, (11) Brahma, (12) Kaivalya, (13) J&#257;v&#257;la, (14) &#346;vet&#257;&#347;va, (15) Hansa, (16) Arunih, (17) Garbha, (18) Narayana, etc. These 108 Upanisads contain all knowledge about the Absolute Truth. Sometimes people inquire abou the meaning of these 108 prayer beads, but because we think there are 108 Upanisads which contain full knowledge of the Absolute Truth, therefore 108 beads are accepted. Sometimes on the other hand, the Vaishnava transcendentalists think that the 108 beads represent the 108 companions of Lord Krishna in His r&#257;sa dance, and therefore 108 beads are accepted.</P><P>Lord Caitanya protested against misinterpretations of the Upanishads, and He rejected any explanation which did not give the direct meaning of the Upanishads. The direct interpretation is called abhidh&#257;-vritti, whereas the indirect interpretation is called lakshan&#257;-vritti, The indirect interpretation serves no purpose. There are four kinds of understanding, called: (1) direct understanding (pratyaksha), (2) hypothetical understanding (anum&#257;na), (3) historical understanding (aitihya) and (4) understanding through sound (&#347;abda). Of these four, understanding from the Vedic scriptures (which are the sound representations of the Absolute Truth) is the best method. The traditional Vedic students accept understanding through sound to be the best.</P><P>The stool and bone of any living entity are considered to be impure according to Vedic literatures, yet the Vedic literatures assert that cow dung and conchshells are pure. Apparently these statements are contradictory, but because cow dung and conchshells are considered pure by the Vedas, they are accepted as pure by the followers of the Vedas. If we want to understand the statements by indirect interpretation, then we have to challenge the Vedic statements. In other words, Vedic statements cannot be accepted by our imperfect interpretations; they must be accepted as they are. If they are not accepted in this way, there is no authority in the Vedic statements.</P><P>According to Lord Caitanya, those who try to give personal interpretations to the Vedic statements are not at all intelligent. They mislead their followers by inventing their own interpretations. In India there is a class of men known as &#257;rya-sam&#257;ja who say that they accept the original Vedas only and reject all other Vedic literatures. The motive of these people, however, is to give their own interpretation. According to Lord Caitanya, such interpretations are not to be accepted. They are simply not Vedic. Lord Caitanya said that the Vedic statements of the Upanishads are like sunlight. Everything is clear and very distinct when it is seen in the sunlight; the statements of the Vedas are similarly clear and distinct. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers simply cover the sunlight with the cloud of misinterpretation.</P><P>Lord Caitanya then said that all the Vedic statements of the Upanishads aim at the ultimate truth known as Brahman. The word Brahman means "the greatest," and when we speak of the greatest we immediately refer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the source of all emanations. Unless the greatest possesses six opulences in full, he cannot be called the greatest. The greatest, who is full in six opulences, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, the Supreme Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead as well. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/10/12.htm">10.12</A>) Krishna is accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme Brahman (param brahma). The conceptions of the impersonal Brahman and the localized Supersoul are contained within the understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P>Whenever we speak of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we add the word &#347;r&#299;, indicating that He is full with six opulences. In other words, He is eternally a person; if He were not a person, the six opulences could not be present in fullness. If we say that the Supreme Absolute Truth is impersonal, we mean that His personality is not material. Thus in order to distinguish His transcendental body from ordinary material bodies, some philosophers have explained Him as being impersonal from the material point of view. In other words, material personality is denied, and spiritual personality is established. In the &#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/3/19">3.19</A>) it is clearly explained that the Absolute Truth has no material legs and hands, but in that scripture it is indicated that He has spiritual hands by which He accepts everything offered to Him. Similarly, He has no material eyes, but He does have spiritual eyes by which He can see everything and anything. Although He has no material ears, He can hear everything and anything. Having perfect senses, He knows past, future and present. Indeed, He knows everything, but no one can understand Him, for by material senses He cannot be understood. Being the origin of all emanations, He is the supreme, the greatest, the Personality of Godhead.</P><P>There are many similar Vedic hymns which definitely establish that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person who is not of this material world. For instance, in the Haya&#347;&#299;rsha-pañcar&#257;tra it is explained that although in each and every Upanishad the Supreme Brahman is first viewed as impersonal, at the end the personal form of the Supreme Lord is accepted. A similar verse occurs in &#346;r&#299; &#298;&#347;opanishad:</P><P>hiranmayena p&#257;trena</P><P CLASS=n>satyasy&#257;pihitam mukham</P><P CLASS=n>tat tvam p&#363;shann ap&#257;vrinu</P><P CLASS=n>satya-dharm&#257;ya drishtaye</P><P>"O my Lord, sustainer of all that lives, Your real face is covered by Your dazzling effulgence. Please remove that covering and exhibit Yourself to Your pure devotee." (I&#347;a. 15)</P><P>This verse indicates that everyone should engage in devotional service to the Supreme Lord, who is the maintainer of this whole universe. Everyone is sustained by His mercy; therefore devotional service unto Him constitutes the true religion. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the eternal form of sac-cid-&#257;nanda, and His effulgence is spread throughout the creation, just as sunshine is spread throughout the solar system. And just as the sun disc is covered by the glaring effulgence of the sunshine, the transcendental form of the Lord is covered by the glaring effulgence called brahmajyoti. Indeed, in this verse it is clearly stated that the eternal, blissful, cognizant form of the Supreme Lord is to be found within the glaring effulgence of the brahmajyoti, which emanates from the body of the Supreme Lord. Thus the personal body of the Lord is the source of the brahmajyoti, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/14/27.htm">Bg. 14.27</A>). That the impersonal Brahman is dependent on the Supreme Personality is stated in the Haya&#347;&#299;rsha-pañcar&#257;tra and in every other Upanishad or Vedic scripture. Indeed, whenever there is talk of the impersonal Brahman in the beginning, the Supreme Personality is finally established at the end. Just as &#298;&#347;opanishad indicates, the Supreme Absolute Truth is both impersonal and personal eternally, but His personal aspect is more important than the impersonal one.</P><P>According to a mantra in Taittir&#299;ya Upanishad (yato v&#257; im&#257;ni bh&#363;t&#257;ni j&#257;yante) this cosmic manifestation is but an emanation from the Supreme Absolute Truth, and it rests in the Supreme Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth has been called the ablative, causative and locative performer. Thus as a performer, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for these are symptoms of personality. As the ablative performer of this cosmic manifestation, all thinking, feeling and willing come from Him. Without thinking, feeling and willing, there is no possibility of arrangement and design in the cosmic manifestation. Then again, He is causative, for He is the original designer of the cosmos. And He is locative: that is, everything is resting in His energy. These attributes are all clearly attributes of personality.</P><P>In the Ch&#257;ndogya Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/5/2/3">5.2.3</A>), it is said that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead desires to become many, He turns over material nature. As also confirmed in Aitareya Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/1/1">1.1</A>), sa aikshata: "The Lord glanced at material nature." The cosmic manifestation did not exist before His glance; therefore His glance is not materially contaminated. His seeing power existed before the material creation; therefore His body is not material. His thinking, feeling and acting are all transcendental. In other words, it should be concluded that the mind by which the Lord thinks, feels and wills is transcendental, and the eyes by which He glances over material nature are also transcendental. Since His transcendental body and all His senses existed before the material creation, the Lord also has a transcendental mind and transcendental thinking, feeling and willing. This is the conclusion of all Vedic literature.</P><P>The word Brahman is found everywhere throughout the Upanishads. In &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; and Bhagav&#257;n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are all taken together as the Absolute Truth. Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257; realization are considered stages toward the ultimate realization, which is realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the real conclusion of all Vedic literatures.</P><P>Thus according to the evidences afforded by various Vedic scriptures, the Supreme Lord Krishna is accepted as the ultimate goal of Brahman realization. Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/7/7.htm">Bg. 7.7</A>) also confirms that there is nothing superior to Krishna. Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, one of the greatest &#257;c&#257;ryas in Brahm&#257;'s disciplic succession, has stated in his explanation to the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra that everything can be seen through the authorities of the scriptures. He quoted a verse from Skanda Pur&#257;na in which it is stated that the Rig Veda, S&#257;ma Veda, Atharva Veda, Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Pañcar&#257;tra and the original R&#257;m&#257;yana are actually Vedic evidence. The Pur&#257;nas, which are accepted by the Vaishnavas, are also considered to be Vedic evidence. Indeed, whatever is contained in that literature should be taken without argument as the ultimate conclusion, and all these literatures proclaim Krishna to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=725"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
