Those, who entertain such discriminating sentiment, commit a great offense against the Supreme Lord. The supremacy of &#346;ambhu is subservient to that of Govinda; hence they are not really different from each other. The nondistinction is established by the fact that just as milk treated with acid turns into curd so Godhead becomes a subservient when He Himself attains a distinct personality by the addition of a particular element of adulteration. This personality has no independent initiative. The said adulterating principle is constituted of a combination of the stupefying quality of the deluding energy, the quality of nonplenitude of the marginal potency and a slight degree of the ecstatic-cum-cognitive principle of the plenary spiritual potency. This specifically adulterated reflection of the principle of the subjective portion of the Divinity is Sad&#257;&#347;iva, in the form of the effulgent masculine-symbol-god &#346;ambhu from whom Rudradeva is manifested. In the work of mundane creation as the material cause, in the work of preservation by the destruction of sundry asuras and in the work of destruction to conduct the whole operation, Govinda manifests Himself as guna-avat&#257;ra in the form of &#346;ambhu who is the separated portion of Govinda imbued with the principle of His subjective plenary portion. The personality of the destructive principle in the form of time has been identified with that of &#346;ambhu by scriptural evidences that have been adduced in the commentary. The purport of the Bh&#257;gavata &#347;lokas, viz., vaishnav&#257;n&#257;m yath&#257; &#347;ambhuh, etc., is that &#346;ambhu, in pursuance of the will of Govinda, works in union with his consort Durg&#257;dev&#299; by his own time energy. He teaches pious duties (dharma) as stepping-stones to the attainment of spiritual service in the various tantra-&#347;&#257;stras, etc., suitable for j&#299;vas in different grades of the conditional existence. In obedience to the will of Govinda, &#346;ambhu maintains and fosters the religion of pure devotion by preaching the cult of illusionism (M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da) and the speculative &#257;gama-&#347;&#257;stras. The fifty attributes of individual souls are manifest in a far vaster measure in &#346;ambhu and five additional attributes not attainable by j&#299;vas are also partly found in him. So &#346;ambhu cannot be called a j&#299;va. He is the lord of j&#299;va but yet partakes of the nature of a separated portion of Govinda.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=403"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
