Still her connection is not entirely cut off from the Absolute Truth. When He intends to create the material world the amorous pastime, in which He engages by consorting with His own spiritual [cit] potency Ram&#257; by casting His glance at the deluding energy in the shape of sending His time energy, is an auxiliary activity.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The illusory energy has no direct contact with Krishna, but has got indirect contact. Vishnu the prime cause, lying in the Causal Ocean, the plenary portion of Mah&#257;-Sa&#324;karshana who has His scat in Mah&#257;-Vaikuntha the sphere of Krishna's own extended transcendental pastimes, casts His glance towards the deluding energy. Even in casting His glance He has no contact with the deluding energy because the spiritual (cit) potency Ram&#257; then carries the function of His glance as His unpolluted ever-submissive potency. The deluding energy as the maidservant of the spiritual (cit) potency Ram&#257;, serves the manifested plenary portion of Godhead consorted with Ram&#257;, the time energy representing the force of activity and instrumentality of Ram&#257;; hence there is found the process of masculinity or the creative force.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=403"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
