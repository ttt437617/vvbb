In this mundane world the appearance of individual entities as separated egotistic symbols, is the limited perverted reflection of the unalloyed spiritual (cit) potency; and, as representing the primal masculine divine generative function &#346;ambhu, it is united to the accommodating principle, viz., the mundane female organ which is the perverted reflection of the spiritual (cit) potency, Ram&#257;dev&#299;. At this function &#346;ambhu is nothing but the mere material causal principle embodying the extension in the shape of ingredient as matter. Again when in course of the progressive evolution of mundane creation each universe is manifested, then in the principle of &#346;ambhu, born of the space between the two eyebrows of Vishnu, there appears the manifestation of the personality of Rudra; yet under all circumstances &#346;ambhu fully enshrines the mundane egotistic principle. The innumerable j&#299;vas as spiritual particles emanating from the oversoul in the form of pencils of rays of effulgence, have no relation with the mundane world when they come to know themselves to be the eternal servants of the Supreme Lord. They are then incorporated into the realm of Vaikuntha. But when they desire to lord it over M&#257;y&#257;, forgetting their real identity. the egotistic principle &#346;ambhu entering into their entities makes them identify themselves as separated enjoyers of mundane entities. Hence &#346;ambhu is the primary principle of the egotistic mundane universe and of perverted egotism in j&#299;vas that identifies itself with their limited material bodies.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=403"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
