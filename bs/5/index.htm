He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>BS 5.2</B></A>: [The spiritual place of transcendental pastimes of Krishna is portrayed in the second verse.] The superexcellent station of Krishna, which is known as Gokula, has thousands of petals and a corolla like that of a lotus sprouted from a part of His infinitary aspect, the whorl of the leaves being the actual abode of Krishna.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>BS 5.3</B></A>: The whorl of that transcendental lotus is the realm wherein dwells Krishna. It is a hexagonal figure, the abode of the indwelling predominated and predominating aspect of the Absolute. Like a diamond the central supporting figure of self-luminous Krishna stands as the transcendental source of all potencies. The holy name consisting of eighteen transcendental letters is manifested in a hexagonal figure with sixfold divisions.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>BS 5.4</B></A>: The whorl of that eternal realm Gokula is the hexagonal abode of Krishna. Its petals are the abodes of gop&#299;s who are part and parcel of Krishna to whom they are most lovingly devoted and are similar in essence. The petals shine beautifully like so many walls. The extended leaves of that lotus are the gardenlike dh&#257;ma, i.e. spiritual abode of &#346;r&#299; R&#257;dhik&#257;, the most beloved of Krishna.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>BS 5.5</B></A>: [The surrounding external plane of Gokula is described in this verse.] There is a mysterious quadrangular place named &#346;vetadv&#299;pa surrounding the outskirts of Gokula. &#346;vetadv&#299;pa is divided into four parts on all sides. The abode of V&#257;sudeva, Sa&#324;karshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are separately located in each of these four parts. These four divided abodes are enveloped by the fourfold human requirements such as piety, wealth, passion and liberation, as also by the four Vedas, viz., Rig, S&#257;ma, Yajur and Atharva, which deal with the mantra and which are the bases of achievements of the fourfold mundane requirements. Ten tridents are fixed in the ten directions, including the zenith and nadir. The eight directions are decorated with the eight jewels of Mah&#257;padma, Padma, &#346;a&#324;kha, Makara, Kacchapa, Mukunda, Kunda, and N&#299;la. There are ten protectors [dik-p&#257;las] of the ten directions in the form of mantra. The associates of the hues of blue, yellow, red and white and the extraordinary potencies bearing the names of Vimala, etc., shine on all sides.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>BS 5.6</B></A>: The Lord of Gokula is the transcendental Supreme Godhead, the own Self of eternal ecstasies. He is the superior of all superiors and is busily engaged in the enjoyments of the transcendental realm and has no association with His mundane potency.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>BS 5.7</B></A>: Krishna never consorts with His illusory energy. Still her connection is not entirely cut off from the Absolute Truth. When He intends to create the material world the amorous pastime, in which He engages by consorting with His own spiritual [cit] potency Ram&#257; by casting His glance at the deluding energy in the shape of sending His time energy, is an auxiliary activity.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>BS 5.8</B></A>: [The secondary process of association with M&#257;y&#257; is described.] Ram&#257;dev&#299;, the spiritual [cit] potency, beloved consort of the Supreme Lord, is the regulatrix of all entities. The divine plenary portion of Krishna creates the mundane world. At creation there appears a divine halo of the nature of His own subjective portion [sv&#257;m&#347;a]. This halo is divine &#346;ambhu, the masculine symbol or manifested emblem of the Supreme Lord. This halo is the dim twilight reflection of the supreme eternal effulgence. This masculine symbol is the subjective portion of divinity who functions as progenitor of the mundane world, subject to the supreme regulatrix [niyati]. The conceiving potency in regard to mundane creation makes her appearance out of the supreme regulatrix. She is M&#257;y&#257;, the limited, nonabsolute [apar&#257;] potency, the symbol of mundane feminine productivity. The intercourse of these two brings forth the faculty of perverted cognition, the reflection of the seed of the procreative desire of the Supreme Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>BS 5.9</B></A>: All offspring of the consort of the great lord [Mahe&#347;vara] of this mundane world are of the nature of the embodiment of the mundane masculine and feminine generative organs.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>BS 5.10</B></A>: The person embodying the material causal principle, viz., the great lord of this mundane world [Mahe&#347;vara] &#346;amhhu, in the form of the male generating organ, is joined to his female consort the limited energy [M&#257;y&#257;] as the efficient causal principle. The Lord of the world Mah&#257;-Vishnu is manifest in him by His subjective portion in the form of His glance.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>BS 5.11</B></A>: The Lord of the mundane world, Mah&#257;-Vishnu, possesses thousands of thousands of heads, eyes, hands. He is the source of thousands of thousands of avat&#257;ras in His thousands of thousands of subjective portions. He is the creator of thousands of thousands of individual souls.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>BS 5.12</B></A>: The same Mah&#257;-Vishnu is spoken of by the name of "N&#257;r&#257;yana" in this mundane world. From that eternal person has sprung the vast expanse of water of the spiritual Causal Ocean. The subjective portion of Sa&#324;karshana who abides in paravyoma, the above supreme purusha with thousands of subjective portions, reposes in the state of divine sleep [yoga-nidr&#257;] in the waters of the spiritual Causal Ocean.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>BS 5.13</B></A>: The spiritual seeds of Sa&#324;karshana existing in the pores of skin of Mah&#257;-Vishnu, are born as so many golden sperms. These sperms are covered with five great elements.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>BS 5.14</B></A>: The same Mah&#257;-Vishnu entered into each universe as His own separate subjective portions. The divine portions, that entered into each universe are possessed of His majestic extension, i.e., they are the eternal universal soul Mah&#257;-Vishnu, possessing thousands of thousands of heads.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>BS 5.15</B></A>: The same Mah&#257;-Vishnu created Vishnu from His left limb, Brahm&#257;, the first progenitor of beings, from His right limb and, from the space between His two eyebrows, &#346;ambhu, the divine masculine manifested halo.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>BS 5.16</B></A>: The function of &#346;ambhu in relation to j&#299;vas is that this universe enshrining the mundane egotistic principle has originated from &#346;ambhu.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>BS 5.17</B></A>: Thereupon the same great personal Godhead, assuming the threefold forms of Vishnu, Praj&#257;pati and &#346;ambhu, entering into the mundane universe, plays the pastimes of preservation, creation and destruction of this world. This pastime is contained in the mundane world. Hence, it being perverted, the Supreme Lord, identical with Mah&#257;-Vishnu, prefers to consort with the goddess Yoganidr&#257;, the constituent of His own spiritual [cit] potency full of the ecstatic trance of eternal bliss appertaining to His own divine personality.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>BS 5.18</B></A>: When Vishnu lying in the ocean of milk wills to create this universe, a golden lotus springs from His navel-pit. The golden lotus with its stem is the abode of Brahm&#257; representing Brahmaloka or Satyaloka.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>BS 5.19</B></A>: Before their conglomeration the primary elements in their nascent state remained originally separate entities. Nonapplication of the conglomerating process is the cause of their separate existence. Divine Mah&#257;-Vishnu, primal Godhead, through association with His own spiritual [cit] potency, moved M&#257;y&#257; and by the application of the conglomerating principle created those different entities in their state of cooperation. And alter that He Himself consorted with Yoganidr&#257; by way of His eternal dalliance with His spiritual [cit] potency.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>BS 5.20</B></A>: By conglomerating all those separate entities He manifested the innumerable mundane universes and Himself entered into the inmost recess of every extended conglomerate [virad-vigraha]. At that time those j&#299;vas who had lain dormant during the cataclysm were awakened.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>BS 5.21</B></A>: The same j&#299;va is eternal and is for eternity and without a beginning joined to the Supreme Lord by the tie of an eternal kinship. He is transcendental spiritual potency.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>BS 5.22</B></A>: The divine lotus which springs from the navel-pit of Vishnu is in every way related by the spiritual tie with all souls and is the origin of four-faced Brahm&#257; versed in the four Vedas.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>BS 5.23</B></A>: On coming out of the lotus, Brahm&#257;, being guided by the divine potency tuned his mind to the act of creation under the impulse of previous impressions. But he could see nothing but darkness in every direction.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>BS 5.24</B></A>: Then the goddess of learning Sarasvat&#299;, the divine consort of the Supreme Lord, said thus to Brahm&#257; who saw nothing but gloom in all directions, "O Brahm&#257;, this mantra, viz., kl&#299;m krishn&#257;ya govind&#257;ya gop&#299;-jana-vallabh&#257;ya sv&#257;h&#257;, will assuredly fulfill your heart's desire."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm"><B>BS 5.25</B></A>: "O Brahm&#257;, do thou practice spiritual association by means of this mantra; then all your desires will be fulfilled."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>BS 5.26</B></A>: Brahm&#257;, being desirous of satisfying Govinda, practiced the cultural acts for Krishna in Goloka, Lord of &#346;vetadv&#299;pa, for a long time. His meditation ran thus, "There exists a divine lotus of a thousand petals, augmented by millions of filaments, in the transcendental land of Goloka. On its whorl, there exists a great divine throne on which is seated &#346;r&#299; Krishna, the form of eternal effulgence of transcendental bliss, playing on His divine flute resonant with the divine sound, with His lotus mouth. He is worshiped by His amorous milkmaids with their respective subjective portions and extensions and also by His external energy [who stays outside] embodying all mundane qualities."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>BS 5.27</B></A>: Then G&#257;yatr&#299;, mother of the Vedas, being made manifest, i.e. imparted, by the divine sound of the flute of &#346;r&#299; Krishna, entered into the lotus mouth of Brahm&#257;, born from himself, through his eight ear-holes. The lotus-born Brahm&#257; having received the G&#257;yatr&#299;, sprung from the flute-song of &#346;r&#299; Krishna, attained the status of the twice-born, having been initiated by the supreme primal preceptor, Godhead Himself.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>BS 5.28</B></A>: Enlightened by the recollection of that G&#257;yatr&#299;, embodying the three Vedas, Brahm&#257; became acquainted with the expanse of the ocean of truth. Then he worshiped &#346;r&#299; Krishna, the essence of all Vedas, with this hymn.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>BS 5.29</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor who is tending the cows, yielding all desire, in abodes built with spiritual gems, surrounded by millions of purpose trees, always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of lakshm&#299;s or gop&#299;s.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>BS 5.30</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept in playing on His flute, with blooming eyes like lotus petals with head decked with peacock's feather, with the figure of beauty tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and His unique loveliness charming millions of Cupids.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>BS 5.31</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, round whose neck is swinging a garland of flowers beautified with the moon-locket, whose two hands are adorned with the flute and jeweled ornaments, who always revels in pastimes of love, whose graceful threefold-bending form of &#346;y&#257;masundara is eternally manifest.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>BS 5.32</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental form is full of bliss, truth, substantiality and is thus full of the most dazzling splendor. Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses in Himself, the full-fledged functions of all the organs, and eternally sees, maintains and manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>BS 5.33</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is inaccessible to the Vedas, but obtainable by pure unalloyed devotion of the soul, who is without a second, who is not subject to decay, is without a beginning, whose form is endless, who is the beginning, and the eternal purusha; yet He is a person possessing the beauty of blooming youth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>BS 5.34</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, only the tip of the toe of whose lotus feet is approached by the yog&#299;s who aspire after the transcendental and betake themselves to pr&#257;n&#257;y&#257;ma by drilling the respiration; or by the jñ&#257;n&#299;s who try to find out the nondifferentiated Brahman by the process of elimination of the mundane, extending over thousands of millions of years.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm"><B>BS 5.35</B></A>: He is an undifferentiated entity as there is no distinction between potency and the possessor thereof. In His work of creation of millions of worlds, His potency remains inseparable. All the universes exist in Him and He is present in His fullness in every one of the atoms that are scattered throughout the universe, at one and the same time. Such is the primeval Lord whom I adore.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>BS 5.36</B></A>: I adore the same Govinda, the primeval Lord, in whose praise men, who are imbued with devotion, sing the mantra-s&#363;ktas told by the Vedas, by gaining their appropriate beauty, greatness, thrones, conveyances and ornaments.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>BS 5.37</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, residing in His own realm, Goloka, with R&#257;dh&#257;, resembling His own spiritual figure, the embodiment of the ecstatic potency possessed of the sixty-four artistic activities, in the company of Her confidantes [sakh&#299;s], embodiments of the extensions of Her bodily form, permeated and vitalized by His ever-blissful spiritual rasa.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm"><B>BS 5.38</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is &#346;y&#257;masundara, Krishna Himself with inconceivable innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm"><B>BS 5.39</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who manifested Himself personally as Krishna and the different avat&#257;ras in the world in the forms of R&#257;ma, Nrisimha, V&#257;mana, etc., as His subjective portions.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm"><B>BS 5.40</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose effulgence is the source of the nondifferentiated Brahman mentioned in the Upanishads, being differentiated from the infinity of glories of the mundane universe appears as the indivisible, infinite, limitless, truth.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm"><B>BS 5.41</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is the absolute substantive principle being the ultimate entity in the form of the support of all existence whose external potency embodies the threefold mundane qualities, viz., sattva, rajas, and tamas and diffuses the Vedic knowledge regarding the mundane world.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm"><B>BS 5.42</B></A>: I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose glory ever triumphantly dominates the mundane world by the activity of His own pastimes, being reflected in the mind of recollecting souls as the transcendental entity of ever-blissful cognitive rasa.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm"><B>BS 5.43</B></A>: Lowest of all is located Dev&#299;-dh&#257;ma [mundane world], next above it is Mahe&#347;a-dh&#257;ma [abode of Mahe&#347;a]; above Mahe&#347;a-dh&#257;ma is placed Hari-dh&#257;ma [abode of Hari] and above them all is located Krishna's own realm named Goloka.
