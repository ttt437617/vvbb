Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses in Himself, the full-fledged functions of all the organs, and eternally sees, maintains and manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>For want of a taste of things spiritual, a grave doubt arises in the minds of those who are enchained by worldly knowledge. On hearing a narration of the pastimes of Krishna they think that the truth (tattva) regarding Krishna is the mental concoction of certain learned scholars, created by their imaginative brains out of material drawn from the mundane principles. With the object of removing this harmful doubt, Brahm&#257; in this and the three following &#347;lokas, after distinguishing between the two things, viz., spirit and matter, in a rational manner, has tried to make one understand the pure l&#299;l&#257; of Krishna, obtained by his unmixed ecstatic trance. Brahm&#257; wants to say that the form of Krishna is all "existence, all-knowledge and all-bliss, whereas all mundane experiences are full of palpable ignorance. Although there is specific difference between the two, the fundamental truth is that spiritual affairs constitute the absolute source. Specification and variegatedness are ever present in it. By them are established the transcendental abode, form, name, quality and sports of Krishna. It is only by a person, possessed of pure spiritual knowledge and freedom from any relationship with M&#257;y&#257;, that those amorous pastimes of Krishna can at all be appreciated. The spiritual abode, the seat of pastimes, emanated from the cit potency and formed of cint&#257;mani (transcendental philosopher's stone), and the figure of Krishna, are all spiritual. Just as M&#257;y&#257; is the perverted reflection of the spiritual potency. the variegatedness created by M&#257;y&#257; (ignorance) is also a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness. So a mere semblance of the spiritual variegatedness is only noticed in this mundane world. Notwithstanding such semblance the two are wholly different from one another. The unwholesomeness of matter is its defect; but in the spirit there is variegatedness which is free from any fault or contamination. The soul and the body of Krishna are identical, whereas the body and soul of fallen creatures are not so. In the spiritual sphere there is no such difference as that between the body and soul, between the limbs and their proprietor, between the attributes and the object possessing them, of this world. But such difference really exists in the case of conditioned souls. Limbed though Krishna is, His every limb is the whole entity. He performs all varieties of divine spiritual functions with every one of His limbs. Hence He is an indivisible whole and a perfect transcendental entity. Both j&#299;va-soul and Krishna are transcendental. So they belong to the same category. But they differ in this that the transcendental attributes exist in the j&#299;va-soul in infinitesimally small degrees, whereas in Krishna they are found in their fullest perfection. Those attributes manifest themselves in their proper infinitesimality only when the j&#299;va-soul attains his unadulterated spiritual status. The j&#299;va-soul attains the nearest approach to the absolute identity only when the spiritual force of ecstatic energy appears in him by the grace of Krishna. Still Krishna remains the object of universal homage by reason of His possession of certain unique attributes. These fourfold unrivaled attributes do not manifest themselves in N&#257;r&#257;yana, the Lord of Vaikuntha or in primeval purusha-avat&#257;ras, or in the highest deities such as &#346;iva, not to speak of j&#299;vas.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=403"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
