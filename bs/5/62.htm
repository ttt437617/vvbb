I am pradh&#257;na [the substance of matter], I am prakriti [material cause] and I am purusha [efficient cause]. This fiery energy that belongs specially to the Brahman, that inheres in you, has also been conferred by Me. It is by bearing this fiery energy that you regulate this phenomenal world of animate and inanimate objects."</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Certain thinkers conclude that the nondifferentiated Brahman is the ultimate entity and by undergoing self-delusion (vivarta) exhibits the consciousness of differentiation; or, the limiting principle itself (M&#257;y&#257;), when it is limited, is the phenomenal world and is itself the Brahman, in its unlimited position; or, the Brahman is the substance and this phenomenal world is the reflection; or, everything is an illusion of the j&#299;va. Some think that Godhead is evidently a separate entity. J&#299;va is another different entity. and the phenomenal world, although it is a singular principle, exists separately as an eternally independent entity; or, Godhead, is the substantive entity and all other entities, as cit and a-cit attributes, are one in principle. Some suppose that by the force of inconceivable potency sometimes the monistic and sometimes the dualistic principle is realized as the truth. Some again arrive at the conclusion that the theory of the nondual minus all potency is meaningless; whence the Brahman is the one eternally unalloyed entity vested with the pure potency.</P><P>These speculations have originated from Veda relying on the support of the Ved&#257;nta-sutra. In these speculations although there is no truth that holds good in all positions, there is yet a certain measure of truth. Not to speak of the anti-Vedic speculations S&#257;&#324;khya, Patañjala, Ny&#257;ya and Vai&#347;eshika, nor even of P&#363;rva-m&#299;m&#257;ms&#257; which is fond of exclusive fruitive activity in conformity with the teaching of one portion of the Veda, the bodies of opinions detailed above have also come into existence by relying outwardly on the Ved&#257;nta itself. By discarding all these speculations, you and your bona fide community should adopt the ultimate principle identical with the doctrine of acintya-bhed&#257;bheda (inconceivable simultaneous distinction and nondifference). This will make you eligible for being a true devotee. The basic principle is that this animate world is made up of j&#299;vas and the inanimate world is constituted of matter. Of these all the j&#299;vas have been manifested by My supreme (par&#257;) potency and this phenomenal world has been manifested by My secondary (apar&#257;) potency. I am the cause of all causes. In other words, I regulate all of them by the power of My will although I am not a different entity from the marginal and material (tatasth&#257; and acit) potencies. By the transformation of those distinct potencies pradh&#257;na (substantive material principle), prakriti (material cause) and purusha (efficient cause) have been produced. Hence although as regards the subjective nature of all potency I am pradh&#257;na, prakriti and purusha, yet as the possessor of power I am eternally distinct from all those potencies. This simultaneous distinction and nondifference has also sprung from My inconceivable power. So let the attainment of love for Krishna by the practice of pure devotion through the knowledge of their mutual true relationship that subsists between the j&#299;va, the jada (matter) and Krishna based on the principle of inconceivable simultaneous distinction and non-difference, be My instruction for being handed down in the order of spiritual preceptional succession in your community (&#346;r&#299; Brahma-samprad&#257;ya).</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="61.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="../index.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=403"><IMG SRC="../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
