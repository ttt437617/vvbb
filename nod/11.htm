It is said there that a person who is constantly engaged in devotional service by his body, mind and words, or even a person who is not practically engaged but is simply desiring to be so, is considered to be liberated.</P><P>Devotional Service in Friendship</P><P>Devotional service in friendship can be divided into two categories: the first is to act as the confidential servant of the Lord, and the other is to act as the well-wisher of the Lord. The devotee who has confidence in devotional service to the Lord systematically follows the rules and regulations, with the faith that lie will achieve the platform of transcendental life. The second type of devotional friendship is to become a well-wisher of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; it is said that the Lord accepts a preacher as the most dear servant. Anyone who is preaching the confidential message of the G&#299;t&#257; to the people in general is so dear to Krishna that no one can be equal to him in human society.</P><P>In the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Draupad&#299; says, "My dear Govinda, Your promise is that Your devotee can never be vanquished. I believe in that statement, and therefore in all kinds of tribulations I simply remember Your promise, and thus I live." The purport is that Draupad&#299; and her five husbands, the P&#257;ndavas, were put into severe tribulations by their cousin-brother Duryodhana, as well as by others. The tribulations were so severe that even Bh&#299;shmadeva, who was both a lifelong brahmac&#257;r&#299; and a great warrior, would sometimes shed tears thinking of them. He was always surprised that although the P&#257;ndavas were so righteous and Draupad&#299; was practically the goddess of fortune, and although Krishna was their friend, still they had to undergo such severe tribulations. Though their tribulations were not ordinary, Draupad&#299; was not discouraged. She knew that because Krishna was their friend, ultimately they would be saved.</P><P>A similar statement is there in the Eleventh Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, Second Chapter, verse 53, where Havi, the son of King Rishabha, addresses Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi: "My dear King, a person who never deviates even for a moment from engagement in service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Person (engagement which is sought even by great demigods like Indra), with firm conviction that there is nothing more worshipable or desirable than this, is called the first-class devotee."</P><P>&#346;r&#299; R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that a neophyte devotee who has simply developed a slight love of Godhead is certainly a prospective candidate for devotional service. When he becomes firmly fixed in such devotional service, that assured status becomes a confidential part of his devotional service.</P><P>Sometimes it is found that a pure devotee lies down in the temple of the Lord in order to serve Him as a confidential friend. Such friendly behavior of a devotee may be accepted as r&#257;g&#257;nug&#257;, or spontaneous. Although, according to regulative principles, no one can lie down in the temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this spontaneous love of Godhead may be grouped under devotional service in friendship.</P><P>Surrendering Everything to the Lord</P><P>Regarding complete self-surrender, there is a nice description in the Eleventh Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, Twenty-ninth Chapter, verse 34, where the Lord says, "A person who has completely surrendered unto Me and has completely given up all other activities is protected by Me personally, both in this life and in the next. In other words, I wish to help him become more and more advanced in spiritual life. Such a person is to be understood as having already achieved s&#257;rshti [having equal opulences with the Supreme]." It is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; that as soon as a person surrenders unto the lotus feet of Krishna, Krishna takes charge of him and gives him a guarantee of protection from all sinful reactions. He also instructs from within, so that the devotee may very quickly make advancement toward spiritual perfection.</P><P>This self-surrender is called &#257;tma-nivedana. According to different authorities, self is differently defined. Self is sometimes considered to refer to the spirit self, or soul, and self is sometimes considered to refer to the mind or to the body. Full self-surrender, therefore, means not only surrendering one's self as spirit soul, but also surrendering one's mind and body to the service of the Lord. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda Th&#257;kura has sung a nice song in this connection. While offering himself as a fully surrendered soul, he said, "My mind, my household affairs, my body, whatever is in my possession, my dear Lord, I offer to You for Your service. Now You can do with them as You like. You are the supreme possessor of everything, so if You like You can kill me, or if You like You can give me protection. All authority belongs to You. I have nothing to claim as my own."</P><P>&#346;r&#299; Y&#257;mun&#257;c&#257;rya, in his prayers to the Lord, has expressed a similar idea in the following words: "My dear Lord, I may be living within some body as a human being or as a demigod, but whatever mode of life, I do not mind, because these bodies are simply by-products of the three modes of material nature, and I, who am in possession of these bodies, am surrendering myself unto You."</P><P>In the Hari-bhakti-viveka, there is a statement regarding how one can offer his body in self-surrender. There the devotee says, "My dear Lord, as a sold animal has no need to think about his maintenance and sustenance, so, because I have given up my body and soul unto You, I am no longer concerned with my maintenance and sustenance." In other words, one should not bother about his personal or family maintenance or sustenance. If one is actually surrendered in body and soul, he should always remember that his only concern is to be engaged in the service of the Lord.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that devotional service in friendship and devotional service in self-surrender are two difficult processes. Therefore such relationships with the Lord can very rarely be seen. Only for the advanced devotees are these two processes easily executed. The purport is that it is very rare to see surrender which is mixed with sincere ecstatic devotion. One must give himself completely to the will of the Lord.</P><P>Offering a Favorite Article</P><P>In the Eleventh Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, Eleventh Chapter, verse 41, Lord Krishna tells Uddhava, "My dear friend, if someone offers Me the best thing in his possession, or anything which is very pleasing to him, he will be eternally benefited."</P><P>Performing All Endeavors for Krishna</P><P>In the N&#257;rada-pañcar&#257;tra there is a statement of how one can act in all spheres of life for the satisfaction of the Lord. It is stated there that a person who is actually in devotional service must be engaged in all kinds of activities &#8212; those prescribed in the revealed scriptures and also those which are accepted for livelihood. In other words, not only should a devotee engage himself in the prescribed duties of devotional service which are mentioned in the revealed scriptures, but he should also perform the duties of his practical life in Krishna consciousness. For example, a devotee who has a great establishment or factory may offer the fruits of such a material possession for the service of the Lord.</P><P>Being a Surrendered Soul</P><P>In the Hari-bhakti-vil&#257;sa there is the following statement about self-surrender: "My dear Lord, a person who has surrendered himself unto You, who is in firm conviction that he is Yours, and who actually acts in that way by his body, mind and words, can actually relish transcendental bliss."</P><P>In the Nrisimha Pur&#257;na, Lord Nrisimhadeva says, "Anyone who prays unto Me and takes shelter from Me becomes My ward, and I protect him always from all sorts of calamities."</P><P>Serving Trees Such as the Tulas&#299;</P><P>In the Skanda Pur&#257;na there is a statement praising the tulas&#299; tree as follows: "Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the tulas&#299; tree, which can immediately vanquish volumes of sinful activities. Simply by seeing or touching this tree one can become relieved from all distresses and diseases. Simply by offering obeisances to and pouring water on the tulas&#299; tree, one can become freed from the fear of being sent to the court of Yamar&#257;ja [the King of death, who punishes the sinful]. If someone sows a tulas&#299; tree somewhere, certainly he becomes devoted to Lord Krishna. And when the tulas&#299; leaves are offered in devotion at the lotus feet of Krishna, there is the full development of love of Godhead."</P><P>In India all Hindus, even those not belonging to the Vaishnava group, take special care of the tulas&#299; tree. Even in great cities where it is very difficult to keep a tulas&#299; tree, people are to be found very carefully keeping this plant. They water it and offer obeisances to it, because worship of the tulas&#299; tree is very important in devotional service.</P><P>In the Skanda Pur&#257;na there is another statement about tulas&#299;, as follows: "Tulas&#299; is auspicious in all respects. Simply by seeing, simply by touching, simply by remembering, simply by praying to, simply by bowing before, simply by hearing about or simply by sowing this tree, there is always auspiciousness. Anyone who comes in touch with the tulas&#299; tree in the above-mentioned ways lives eternally in the Vaikuntha world."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=378"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
