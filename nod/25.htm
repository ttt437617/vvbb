When there is shivering of the body and the hairs of the body stand up, it is to be understood that the devotee is nearing perfection. An example of a s&#257;dhaka cultivating devotional service is Bilvama&#324;gala Th&#257;kura.</P><P>When a devotee is never tired of executing devotional service and is always engaged in Krishna conscious activities, constantly relishing the transcendental mellows in relationship with Krishna, he is called perfect. This perfectional stage can be achieved in two ways: one may achieve this stage of perfection by gradual progress in devotional service, or one may become perfect by the causeless mercy of Krishna, even though he has not executed all the details of devotional service.</P><P>There is the following nice statement in the Third Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, verse 25, of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, describing a devotee who achieves perfection by regularly executing devotional service: A person who is freed from the false egotism of material existence, or an advanced mystic, is eligible to enter into the kingdom of God, known as Vaikuntha. Such a mystic becomes so joyful by constant execution of the regulative principles of devotional service that he thereby achieves the special favor of the Supreme Lord. Yamar&#257;ja, the mighty superintendent of death, is afraid to go near such a devotee; so we can imagine the potency of advanced devotional service, especially when devotees sit together and engage in talking of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those devotees express their feelings in such a way that they automatically melt with ecstasy, and many transcendental symptoms become manifested in their bodies. Anyone desiring advancement in devotional service must follow in the footsteps of such devotees.</P><P>Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja said that no one can attain the perfectional stage of devotional service without bowing down before exalted devotees. Learned sages like M&#257;rkandeya Rishi attained perfection in devotional service simply by executing such regulative principles of service.</P><P>A person's achieving perfection in devotional service simply by the causeless mercy of the Lord is explained in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam in connection with the br&#257;hmanas and their wives who were engaged in performing yajña, or sacrifice. When the wives of the br&#257;hmanas were favored by Lord Krishna and immediately attained the ecstasy of love of Godhead, their husbands said, "How wonderful it is that although these women have undertaken no reformatory performances such as accepting the sacred thread, have not resided in the monasteries of the spiritual master, have not observed the strict principles of celibacy, have not undergone any austerities and have not philosophized upon the observance of ritualistic ceremonies, they still have attained the favor of Krishna, which is aspired after even by great mystics! How wonderful it is that these women have attained such perfection, while we, although br&#257;hmanas who have performed all the reformatory activities, cannot attain to this advanced stage!"</P><P>There is a similar statement by N&#257;rada, addressed to &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;: "My dear &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, you never took the trouble to reside under the care of a spiritual master, and yet you have attained such a great status of transcendental knowledge. You never took the trouble to undergo severe austerities, and still, how wonderful it is that you have been situated in the most perfect stage of love of Godhead."</P><P>&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; and the wives of the br&#257;hmanas performing yajña are vivid examples of devotees who achieved the perfectional stage of devotional service by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P>Eternal Perfection</P><P>Persons who have achieved eternal, blissful life exactly on the level of &#346;r&#299; Krishna, and who are able to attract Lord Krishna by their transcendental loving service, are called eternally perfect. The technical name is nitya-siddha. There are two classes of living entities &#8212; namely, nitya-siddha and nitya-baddha. The distinction is that the nitya-siddhas are eternally Krishna conscious without any forgetfulness, whereas the nitya-baddhas, or eternally conditioned souls, are forgetful of their relationship with Krishna.</P><P>The position of the nitya-siddhas is explained in the Padma Pur&#257;na in connection with the narration of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and Satyabh&#257;m&#257;-dev&#299;. The Lord tells Satyabh&#257;m&#257;, "My dear Satyabh&#257;m&#257;-dev&#299;, I have descended to this earthly planet by the request of Lord Brahm&#257; and other demigods. Those who are born into this family of Yadu are all My eternal associates. My dear wife, you should not consider that My associates are ever separated from Me; they are My personal expansions, and as such, you must know that they are almost as powerful as I am. Because of their transcendental qualities, they are very, very dear to Me, as I am very, very dear to them." Anyone who becomes exhilarated by hearing of the pastimes of Lord Krishna when He was present on this earth with His associates is to be understood as nitya-siddha, eternally perfect.</P><P>In the Tenth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, verse 32, of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam there is this statement: "How wonderful are the fortunate residents of Vrind&#257;vana, such as Nanda and the other cowherd men. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Brahman, has actually become their intimate friend!"</P><P>A similar statement is there in the Tenth Canto, Twenty-sixth Chapter, verse 10, of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam. When Lord Krishna lifted Govardhana Hill, the cowherd men, under the protection of Lord Krishna, became struck with wonder and went to Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and inquired from him, "My dear Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, how is it that we are so intensely attached to Krishna and that Krishna is also so affectionately attached to us? Does it mean that He is the Supersoul of everyone?"</P><P>All of the residents of Vrind&#257;vana and Dv&#257;rak&#257; &#8212; namely, the cowherd men and the members of the Yadu family &#8212; are eternally perfect devotees of the Lord. As the Lord descends by His causeless mercy upon this planet, so, in order to help in the pastimes of the Lord, these devotees also come here. They are not ordinary living entities or conditioned souls; they are ever-liberated persons, associates of the Personality of Godhead. And just as Lord Krishna behaves like an ordinary man when He descends to this planet, so the members of the Yadu dynasty and the residents of Vrind&#257;vana execute activities just like ordinary men. But they are not ordinary men; they are as liberated as Lord Krishna Himself.</P><P>In the Padma Pur&#257;na, Uttara-khanda section, it is stated, "Just as Lord R&#257;macandra descends along with Lakshmana (an expansion of Sa&#324;karshana) and Bharata (an expansion of Pradyumna), so the members of the Yadu dynasty and the cowherd men of Vrind&#257;vana also descend with Lord Krishna in order to join in the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. When the Supreme Lord returns to His eternal abode, His associates return with Him to their respective places. As such, these ever-liberated Vaishnavas are not bound by the material laws of birth and death."</P><P>As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; by the Lord Himself, His birth, deeds and activities are all transcendental. Similarly, the birth, deeds and activities of the associates of the Lord are also transcendental. And as it is an offense to consider oneself to be Krishna, so it is offensive to consider oneself to be Ya&#347;od&#257;, Nanda or any other associate of the Lord. We should always remember that they are transcendental; they are never conditioned souls.</P><P>It is described that Krishna, the enemy of Kamsa, has sixty-four transcendental qualities, and all of the ever-liberated souls who accompany the Lord have the first fifty-five of the qualities, without any doubt. Such devotees are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in any of five transcendental mellows &#8212; namely neutrality, servitorship, friendship, parenthood and conjugal love. These relationships with the Lord are eternal, and therefore nitya-siddha devotees do not have to strive to attain the perfectional stage by executing regulative devotional principles. They are eternally qualified to serve Krishna.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=378"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
