Such manifestations are displays of the transcendental pleasure potency of the Lord. One should simply try to understand that on the spiritual platform there are many varieties of reciprocal love. Such loving exchanges should never be considered to be material. In the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Udyama-parva, it is warned that things which are inconceivable should not be subjected to arguments. Actually, the transactions of the spiritual world are inconceivable to us in our present state of life. Great liberated souls like R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; and others have tried to give us some hints of transcendental activities in the spiritual world, but on the whole these transactions will remain inconceivable to us at the present moment. Understanding the exchanges of transcendental loving service with Krishna is possible only when one is actually in touch with the pleasure potency of the Supreme Lord.</P><P>In this connection &#346;r&#299; R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; gives an example of the clouds in the sky. The clouds in the sky arise from the ocean, and when the clouds become water again and fall to the ground, they glide back to the ocean. Thus the pleasure potency of Krishna is compared to the ocean. The pure devotee is the pleasure-possessing cloud, and when he is filled with transcendental loving service, then he can bestow his mercy as a downpour of rain &#8212; and the pleasure potency returns to the ocean of Krishna.</P><P>Direct and Indirect Attraction for Krishna</P><P>Transcendental pleasure derived from devotional service can be divided into two groups: direct devotional service and indirect devotional service. Direct devotional service is divided into five transcendental humors or flavors, and indirect devotional service is divided into seven transcendental humors. Direct devotional services are as follows: neutrality, servitude, fraternity, paternity and conjugal love. Indirect devotional service is divided into laughter, compassion, anger, chivalry, dread, astonishment and ghastliness. Devotional service can therefore be divided into twelve types, each of which has a different color. The colors are white, multicolored, orange, red, light green, gray, yellow, off-whitish, smoky, pink, black and cloudy. The twelve different kinds of transcendental humors are controlled by different incarnations of God, such as Kapila, M&#257;dhava, Upendra, Nrisimha, Nanda-nandana, Balar&#257;ma, K&#363;rma, Kalki, R&#257;ghava, Bh&#257;rgava, Var&#257;ha and Matsya.</P><P>Sustenance, manifestation, expansion, reflection and lamentation are the five visible symptoms in exchanges of ecstatic love. The test of devotional service can therefore be made in terms of these five symptoms. In the devotional service of neutrality there is sustenance, in chivalrous devotional service there is expansion, in compassionate devotional service there is reflection, in angry devotional service there is lamentation, and so on.</P><P>An apparently pitiable condition in devotional service may appear distressing to the inexperienced student, but the feelings of the devotee in this pitiable condition are considered to be ecstatic by expert devotees. For example, the subject matter of the R&#257;m&#257;yana is sometimes considered pitiable and distressing to the heart, but actually that is not the fact. The R&#257;m&#257;yana narrates how Lord R&#257;ma was sent to the forest by His father just when He was going to be enthroned. After Lord R&#257;ma's departure, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha, His father, died. In the forest His wife, S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;, was kidnapped by R&#257;vana, and there was a great war. When S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299; was finally delivered from the clutches of R&#257;vana, R&#257;vana's whole family and kingdom, and R&#257;vana himself, were vanquished. When S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299; came home she was tried by fire, and after some days she was again banished to the forest. All of these subjects in the R&#257;m&#257;yana seem very pitiable, and they may appear very distressing to the reciter, but actually they are not. Otherwise, why would Hanum&#257;n, the great devotee of Lord R&#257;macandra, read daily about the activities of Lord R&#257;macandra, as described in the R&#257;m&#257;yana itself? The fact is that in any of the above-mentioned twelve transcendental humors of devotional service, everything is transcendentally pleasing.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; mourns in this connection for persons who are in the fire of false renunciation, the dry speculative habit, and who neglect devotional service. Persons who are attached to the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the Vedas and to the impersonal Brahman cannot relish the transcendental pleasure of devotional service. &#346;r&#299; R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; advises, therefore, that devotees who have already tasted the nectar of devotion be very careful to protect devotional service from such dry speculators, formal ritualistic elevationists and impersonal salvationists. Devotees should protect their valuable jewel of spiritual love from the clutches of thieves and burglars. In other words, a pure devotee should not describe devotional service and its different analytical aspects to dry speculators and false renouncers.</P><P>Those who are not devotees can never achieve the benefits of devotional service. For them the subject of devotional service is always very difficult to understand. Only persons who have dedicated their lives unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can relish the real nectar of devotion.</P><P>When one transcends the status of ecstatic love and thus becomes situated on the highest platform of pure goodness, one is understood to have cleansed the heart of all material contamination. In that pure stage of life, one can taste this nectar, and this tasting capacity is technically called rasa, or transcendental mood.</P><P>Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta summary study of the second division of Bhakti-ras&#257;mrita-sindhu, in the matter of general devotional service.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=378"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
