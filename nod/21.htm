The Supreme Personality of Godhead has all these fifty transcendental qualities in fullness as deep as the ocean. In other words, the extent of His qualities is inconceivable.</P><P>As parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the individual living entities can also possess all of these qualities in minute quantities, provided they become pure devotees of the Lord. In other words, all of the above transcendental qualities can be present in the devotees in minute quantity, whereas the qualities in fullness are always present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P>Besides these, there are other transcendental qualities which are described by Lord &#346;iva to P&#257;rvat&#299; in the Padma Pur&#257;na, and in the First Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam in connection with a conversation between the deity of the earth and the King of religion, Yamar&#257;ja. It is said therein, "Persons Who who are desirous of becoming great personalities must be decorated with the following qualities: truthfulness, cleanliness, mercy, perseverance, renunciation, peacefulness, simplicity, control of the senses, equilibrium of the mind, austerity, equality, forbearance, placidity, learning, knowledge, detachment, opulence, chivalry, influence, strength, memory, independence, tactfulness, luster, patience, kind-heartedness, ingenuity, gentility, mannerliness, determination, perfection in all knowledge, proper execution, possession of all objects of enjoyment, gravity, steadiness, faithfulness, fame, respectfulness and lack of false egotism." Persons who are desiring to become great souls cannot be without any of the above qualities, so we can know for certain that these qualities are found in Lord Krishna, the supreme soul.</P><P>Besides all of the above-mentioned fifty qualities, Lord Krishna possesses five more, which are sometimes partially manifested in the persons of Lord Brahm&#257; or Lord &#346;iva. These transcendental qualities are as follows: (51) changeless; (52) all-cognizant; (53) ever fresh; (54) sac-cid-&#257;nanda (possessing an eternal blissful body); (55) possessing all mystic perfections.</P><P>Krishna also possesses five other qualities, which are manifest in the body of N&#257;r&#257;yana, and they are listed as follows. (56) He has inconceivable potency. (57) Uncountable universes generate from His body. (58) He is the original source of all incarnations. (59) He is the giver of salvation to the enemies whom He kills. (60) He is the attractor of liberated souls. All these transcendental qualities are manifest wonderfully in the personal feature of Lord Krishna.</P><P>Besides these sixty transcendental qualities, Krishna has four more, which are not manifest even in the N&#257;r&#257;yana form of Godhead, what to speak of the demigods or living entities. They are as follows. (61) He is the performer of wonderful varieties of pastimes (especially His childhood pastimes). (62) He is surrounded by devotees endowed with wonderful love of Godhead. (63) He can attract all living entities all over the universes by playing on His flute. (64) He has a wonderful excellence of beauty which cannot be rivaled anywhere in the creation.</P><P>Adding to the list these four exceptional qualities of Krishna, it is to be understood that the aggregate number of qualities of Krishna is sixty-four. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has attempted to give evidences from various scriptures about all sixty-four qualities present in the person of the Supreme Lord.</P><P>1. Beautiful Bodily Features</P><P>Any comparison of the different parts of the Lord's body to different material objects cannot factually be a complete comparison. Ordinary persons, who cannot understand how exalted are the bodily features of the Lord, are simply given a chance to understand by a material comparison. It is said that Krishna's face is as beautiful as the moon, His thighs are powerful just like the trunks of elephants, His arms are just like two pillars, His palms are expanded like lotus flowers, His chest is just like a doorway, His hips are dens, and the middle of His body is a terrace.</P><P>2. Auspicious Characteristics</P><P>There are certain characteristics of different limbs which are considered to be very auspicious and are fully present in the body of the Lord. In this connection, one friend of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, speaking about Lord Krishna's auspicious bodily symptoms, said, "My dear King of the cowherds, I can find thirty-two auspicious symptoms on the body of your son! I am wondering how this boy could have taken His birth in a family of cowherd men." Generally, when Lord Krishna appears He does so in a family of kshatriyas (kings), as did Lord R&#257;macandra, and sometimes in a family of br&#257;hmanas. But Krishna accepted the role of son to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nanda, despite the fact that Nanda belonged to the vai&#347;ya community. The business of the vai&#347;ya community is trade, commerce and the protection of cows. Therefore his friend, who may have been born into a br&#257;hmana family, expressed his wonder at how such an exalted child could take birth in a family of vai&#347;yas. Anyway, he pointed out the auspicious signs on the body of Krishna to the boy's foster father.</P><P>He continued, "This boy has a reddish luster in seven places &#8212; His eyes, the ends of His hands, the ends of His legs, His palate, His lips, His tongue and His nails. A reddish luster in these seven places is considered to be auspicious. Three parts of His body are very broad: His waist, forehead and chest. Three parts of His body are short: His neck, thighs and genitals. Three parts of His body are very deep: His voice, intelligence and navel. There is highness in five parts of His body: His nose, arms, ears, forehead and thighs. In five parts of His body there is fineness: His skin, the hairs on His head and on the other parts of His body, His teeth and His fingertips. The aggregate of all these bodily features is manifest only in the bodies of great personalities."</P><P>The fate lines on the palm are also considered to be auspicious bodily symptoms. In this connection, one old gop&#299; informed King Nanda, "Your son possesses various wonderful fate lines on His palms. There are the signs of lotus flowers and wheels on His palms, and on His soles there are the signs of a flag, a thunderbolt, a fish, a rod for controlling elephants, and a lotus flower. Please observe how auspicious these signs are!"</P><P>3. Pleasing</P><P>Beautiful bodily features which automatically attract the eyes are called rucira (pleasing). Krishna possesses this attractive feature of rucira in His personal features. In the Third Canto, Second Chapter, verse 13, of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, there is a statement about this. "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His pleasing dress, appeared at the scene of the sacrificial arena when King Yudhishthira was performing the R&#257;jas&#363;ya sacrifice. All important personalities from different parts of the universe had been invited to the sacrificial arena, and all of them, upon beholding Krishna there, considered that the Creator had ended all of His craftsmanship in the creation of this particular body of Krishna."</P><P>It is said that the transcendental body of Krishna resembles the lotus flower in eight parts &#8212; namely His face, His two eyes, His two hands, His navel and His two feet. The gop&#299;s and inhabitants of Vrind&#257;vana used to see the luster of lotus flowers everywhere, and they could hardly withdraw their eyes from such a vision.</P><P>4. Effulgent</P><P>The effulgence pervading the universe is considered to be the rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The supreme abode of Krishna is always throwing off the effulgence known as brahmajyoti, and that effulgence is emanating from His body.</P><P>The luster of the hosts of jewels fixed on the chest of the Lord can defeat even the luster of the sun, and still, when compared with the bodily luster of the Lord, that crest of jewels appears to be only as bright as one of the stars in the sky. Therefore the transcendental influence of Krishna is so great that it can defeat anyone. When Krishna was present in the sacrificial arena of His enemy King Kamsa, the wrestlers present, although appreciating the softness of the body of &#346;r&#299; Krishna, were afraid and perturbed when they thought of engaging with Him in battle.</P><P>5. Strong</P><P>A person who has extraordinary bodily strength is called bal&#299;y&#257;n. When Krishna killed Arisht&#257;sura, some of the gop&#299;s said, "My dear friends, just see how Krishna has killed Arisht&#257;sura! Although be was stronger than a mountain, Krishna plucked him up just like a piece of cotton and threw him away without any difficulty!" There is another passage wherein it is said, "O my dear devotees of Lord Krishna, may the left hand of Lord Krishna, which has lifted Govardhana Hill like a ball, save you from all dangers."</P><P>6. Ever Youthful</P><P>Krishna is beautiful at His different ages &#8212; namely His childhood, His boyhood and His youth. Out of these three, His youth is the reservoir of all pleasures and is the time when the highest varieties of devotional service are acceptable. At that age, Krishna is full with all transcendental qualities and is engaged in His transcendental pastimes. Therefore, devotees have accepted the beginning of His youth as the most attractive feature in ecstatic love.</P><P>At this age Krishna is described as follows: "The force of Krishna's youth was combined with His beautiful smile, which defeated even the beauty of the full moon. He was always nicely dressed, in beauty surpassing even Cupid, and He was always attracting the minds of the gop&#299;s, who were thereby always feeling pleasure."</P><P>7. Wonderful Linguist</P><P>R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; says that a person who knows the languages of different countries, especially the Sanskrit language, which is spoken in the cities of the demigods &#8212; as well as other worldly languages, including those of the animals &#8212; is called a wonderful linguist. It appears from this statement that Krishna can also speak and understand the languages of the animals. An old woman in Vrind&#257;vana, present at the time of Krishna's pastimes, once stated in surprise, "How wonderful it is that Krishna, who owns the hearts of all the young girls of Vrajabh&#363;mi, can nicely speak the language of Vrajabh&#363;mi with the gop&#299;s, while in Sanskrit He speaks with the demigods, and in the language of the animals He can even speak with the cows and buffalo! Similarly, in the language of the Kashmir Province, and with the parrots and other birds, as well as in most common languages, Krishna is so expressive!" She inquired from the gop&#299;s as to how Krishna had become so expert in speaking so many different types of languages.</P><P>8. Truthful</P><P>A person whose word of honor is never broken is called truthful. Krishna once promised Kunt&#299;, the mother of the P&#257;ndavas, that He would bring her five sons back from the Battlefield of Kurukshetra. After the battle was finished, when all the P&#257;ndavas had come home, Kunt&#299; praised Krishna because His promise was so nicely fulfilled. She said, "Even the sunshine may one day become cool and the moonshine one day become hot, but still Your promise will not fail." Similarly, when Krishna, along with Bh&#299;ma and Arjuna, went to challenge Jar&#257;sandha, He plainly told Jar&#257;sandha that He was the eternal Krishna, present along with two of the P&#257;ndavas. The story is that both Krishna and the P&#257;ndavas &#8212; in this case Bh&#299;ma and Arjuna &#8212; were kshatriyas (warrior-kings). Jar&#257;sandha was also a kshatriya and was very charitable toward the br&#257;hmanas. Thus Krishna, who had planned to fight with Jar&#257;sandha, went to him with Bh&#299;ma and Arjuna in the dress of br&#257;hmanas. Jar&#257;sandha, being very charitable toward the br&#257;hmanas, asked them what they wanted, and they expressed their desire to fight with him. Then Krishna, dressed as a br&#257;hmana, declared Himself to be the same Krishna who was the King's eternal enemy.</P><P>9. Pleasing Talker</P><P>A person who can speak sweetly even with his enemy just to pacify him is called a pleasing talker. Krishna was such a pleasing talker that after defeating His enemy K&#257;liya in the water of the Yamun&#257;, He said, "My dear King of the snakes, although I have given you so much pain, please do not be dissatisfied with Me. It is My duty to protect these cows, which are worshiped even by the demigods. Only in order to save them from the danger of your presence have I been obliged to banish you from this place."</P><P>K&#257;liya was residing within the water of the Yamun&#257;, and as a result the back portion of that river had become poisoned. Thus so many cows who had drunk the water had died. Therefore Krishna, even though He was only four or five years old, dipped Himself into the water, punished K&#257;liya very severely and then asked him to leave the place and go elsewhere.</P><P>Krishna said at that time that the cows are worshiped even by the demigods, and He practically demonstrated how to protect the cows. At least people who are in Krishna consciousness should follow in His footsteps and give all protection to the cows. Cows are worshiped not only by the demigods. Krishna Himself worshiped the cows on several occasions, especially on the days of Gop&#257;shtam&#299; and Govardhana-p&#363;j&#257;.</P><P>10. Fluent</P><P>A person who can speak meaningful words and with all politeness and good qualities is called v&#257;vad&#363;ka, or fluent. There is a nice statement in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam regarding Krishna's speaking politely. When Krishna politely bade His father, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, to stop the ritualistic offering of sacrifice to the rain-god, Indra, a wife of one village cowherd man became captivated. She later thus described the speaking of Krishna to her friends: "Krishna was speaking to His father so politely and gently that it was as if He were pouring nectar into the ears of all present there. After hearing such sweet words from Krishna, who will not be attracted to Him?"</P><P>Krishna's speech, which contains all good qualities in the universe, is described in the following statement by Uddhava: "The words of Krishna are so attractive that they can immediately change the heart of even His opponent. His words can immediately solve all of the questions and problems of the world. Although He does not speak very long, each and every word from His mouth contains volumes of meaning. These speeches of Krishna are very pleasing to my heart."</P><P>11. Highly Learned</P><P>When a person is highly educated and acts strictly on moral principles, he is called highly learned. A person conversant in different departments of knowledge is called educated, and because he acts on moral principles, he is called morally stout. Together, these two factors constitute learning.</P><P>Krishna's receiving education from S&#257;nd&#299;pani Muni is described by &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni as follows: "In the beginning, Lord Brahm&#257; and others are like clouds of evaporated water from the great ocean of Krishna. In other words, Brahm&#257; first received the Vedic education from Krishna, as the clouds receive water from the ocean. That Vedic education or instruction which was spoken by Brahm&#257; to the world was then reposed upon the mountain of S&#257;nd&#299;pani Muni. S&#257;nd&#299;pani Muni's instructions to Krishna are like a reservoir of water on the mountain, which flows as a river and goes again to mix with the source, the ocean of Krishna." To be more clear, the idea is that Krishna actually cannot be instructed by anyone, just as the ocean does not receive water from any source but itself. It only appears that the rivers are pouring water into the ocean. So it is clear that Brahm&#257; received his education from Krishna, and from Brahm&#257;, via the disciplic succession, this Vedic instruction was distributed. S&#257;nd&#299;pani Muni is likened to the river which is flowing down again to that same original ocean of Krishna.</P><P>The Siddhas, the inhabitants of Siddhaloka (where all are born with fully developed mystic powers), and the C&#257;ranas, the inhabitants of a similar planet, pray to Krishna as follows: "My Lord Govinda, the goddess of learning is decorated with fourteen kinds of educational ornaments, her intelligence is all-pervading within the four departments of the Vedas, her attention is always on the lawbooks given by great sages like Manu, and she is appareled in six kinds of expert knowledge &#8212; namely Vedic evidence, grammar, astrology, rhetoric, vocabulary and logic. Her constant friends are the supplements of the Vedas, the Pur&#257;nas, and she is decorated with the final conclusion of all education. And now she has acquired an opportunity to sit with You as a class friend in school, and she is now engaged in Your service."</P><P>Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not require any education, but He gives a chance to the goddess of learning to serve Him. Being self-sufficient, Krishna does not require the service of any living entity, although He has many devotees. It is because Krishna is so kind and merciful that He gives everyone the opportunity to serve Him, as though He required the service of His devotees.</P><P>Regarding His moral principles, it is stated in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam that Krishna is ruling over Vrind&#257;vana as death personified to the thieves, as pleasing bliss to the pious, as the most beautiful Cupid to the young girls and as the most munificent personality to the poor men. He is as refreshing as the full moon to His friends, and to His opponents He is the annihilating fire generated from Lord &#346;iva. Krishna is therefore the most perfect moralist in His reciprocal dealings with different kinds of persons. When He is death personified to the thieves, it is not that He is without moral principles or that He is cruel; He is still kind, because to punish thieves with death is to exhibit the highest quality of moral principles. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, also, Krishna says that He deals with different kinds of persons according to their dealings with Him. Krishna's dealings with devotees and with nondevotees, although different, are equally good. Because Krishna is all-good, His dealings. with everyone are always good.</P><P>12. Highly Intelligent</P><P>A man is called intelligent if he has a sharp memory and fine discretion. As far as Krishna's memory is concerned, it is said that when He was studying in the school of S&#257;nd&#299;pani Muni in Avant&#299;pura, He showed such a sharp memory that by once taking instructions from the teacher He immediately became perfect in any subject. Actually, His going to the school of S&#257;nd&#299;pani Muni was to show the people of the world that however great or ingenious one may be, he must go to higher authorities for general education. However great one may be, he must accept a teacher or spiritual master.</P><P>Krishna's fine discretion was exhibited when He was fighting with the untouchable king who attacked the city of Mathur&#257;. According to Vedic rites, those who are untouchable are not to be touched by the kshatriya kings, not even for killing. Therefore, when the untouchable king seized the city of Mathur&#257;, Krishna did not think it wise to kill him directly with His own hand. Still the king had to be killed, and therefore Krishna decided with fine discretion that He should flee from the battlefield so that the untouchable king would chase Him. He could then lead the king to the mountain where Mucukunda was lying asleep. Mucukunda had received a benediction from K&#257;rttikeya to the effect that when he awoke from his sleep, whomever he might see would at once be burnt to ashes. Therefore Krishna thought it wise to lead the untouchable king to that cave, so that the king's presence would awaken Mucukunda and he would at once be burnt to ashes.</P><P>13. Genius</P><P>A person is called a genius when he can refute any kind of opposing element with newer and newer arguments. In this connection there is a statement in Pady&#257;val&#299; which contains the following conversation between Krishna and R&#257;dh&#257;. One morning, when Krishna came to R&#257;dh&#257;, R&#257;dh&#257; asked Him, "My dear Ke&#347;ava, where is Your v&#257;sa at present?" The Sanskrit word v&#257;sa has three meanings: one meaning is residence, one meaning is fragrance, and another meaning is dress.</P><P>Actually R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299; inquired from Krishna, "Where is Your dress?" But Krishna took the meaning as residence, and He replied to R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;, "My dear captivated one, at the present moment My residence is in Your beautiful eyes."</P><P>To this R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299; replied, "My dear cunning boy, I did not ask You about Your residence. I inquired about Your dress."</P><P>Krishna then took the meaning of v&#257;sa as fragrance and said, "My dear fortunate one, I have just assumed this fragrance in order to be associated with Your body."</P><P>&#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299; again inquired from Krishna, "Where did You pass Your night?" The exact Sanskrit word used in this connection was y&#257;miny&#257;mushitah. Y&#257;miny&#257;m means "at night," and ushitah means "pass." Krishna, however, divided the word y&#257;miny&#257;mushitah into two separate words, namely y&#257;miny&#257; and mushitah. By dividing this word into two, it came out to mean that He was kidnapped by Y&#257;min&#299;, or night. Krishna therefore replied to R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;, "My dear R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;, is it possible that night can kidnap Me?" In this way He was answering all of the questions of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299; so cunningly that He gladdened this dearest of the gop&#299;s.</P><P>14. Artistic</P><P>One who can talk and dress himself very artistically is called vidagdha. This exemplary characteristic was visible in the personality of &#346;r&#299; Krishna. It is spoken of by R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299; as follows: "My dear friend, just see how Krishna has nicely composed songs and how He dances and speaks funny words and plays on His flute, wearing such nice garlands. He has dressed Himself in such an enchanting way, as though He had defeated all kinds of players at the chessboard. He lives wonderfully at the topmost height of artistic craftsmanship."</P><P>15. Clever</P><P>A person who can perform various types of work at once is called clever. In this connection one of the gop&#299;s said, "My dear friends, just see the clever activities of &#346;r&#299; Krishna! He has composed nice songs about the cowherd boys and is pleasing the cows. By the movement of His eyes He is pleasing the gop&#299;s, and at the same time, He is fighting with demons like Arisht&#257;sura. In this way, He is sitting with different living entities in different ways, and He is thoroughly enjoying the situation."</P><P>16. Expert</P><P>Any person who can quickly execute a very difficult task is called expert. About the expertise of Krishna there is a statement in the Tenth Canto, Fifty-ninth Chapter, verse 17, of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, wherein &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; tells Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;kshit, "O best of the Kurus, &#346;r&#299; Krishna cut to pieces all the different weapons used by different fighters." Formerly, fighting was done by releasing different kinds of arrows. One party would release a certain arrow, and the other party had to defeat it by counteracting it with another arrow. For example, one party might release an arrow which would cause water to pour from the sky, and to counteract this the opposing party would have to release an arrow which could immediately turn the water into clouds. So from this statement it appears that Krishna was very expert in counteracting the enemy's arrows. Similarly, at the r&#257;sa dance, each and every gop&#299; requested that Krishna individually become her partner, and Krishna immediately expanded Himself into so many Krishnas in order to be coupled with each and every gop&#299;. The result was that each gop&#299; found Krishna by her side.</P><P>17. Grateful</P><P>Any person who is conscious of his friend's beneficent activities and never forgets his service is called grateful. In the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Krishna says, "When I was away from Draupad&#299;, she cried with the words, 'He govinda!' This call for Me has put Me in her debt, and that indebtedness is gradually increasing in My heart!" This statement by Krishna gives evidence of how one can please the Supreme Lord simply by addressing Him, "He krishna! He govinda!"</P><P>The mah&#257;-mantra (Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare) is also simply an address to the Lord and His energy. So to anyone who is constantly engaged in addressing the Lord and His energy, we can imagine how much the Supreme Lord is obliged. It is impossible for the Lord to ever forget such a devotee. It is clearly stated in this verse that anyone who addresses the Lord immediately attracts the attention of the Lord, who always remains obliged to him.</P><P>Another instance of Krishna's feeling of obligation is stated in connection with His dealings with J&#257;mbav&#257;n. When the Lord was present as Lord R&#257;macandra, J&#257;mbav&#257;n, the great king of the monkeys, rendered very faithful service to Him. When the Lord again appeared as Lord Krishna, He married J&#257;mbav&#257;n's daughter and paid him all the respect that is usually given to superiors. Any honest person is obliged to his friend if some service has been rendered unto Him. Since Krishna is the supreme honest personality, how can He forget an obligation to His servitor?</P><P>18. Determined</P><P>Any person who observes regulative principles and fulfills his promises by practical activity is called determined. As far as the Lord's determination is concerned, there is an example in His dealings in the Hari-vam&#347;a. This is in connection with Lord Krishna's fighting the King of heaven, Indra, who was forcibly deprived of the p&#257;rij&#257;ta flower. P&#257;rij&#257;ta is a kind of lotus flower grown on the heavenly planets. Once, Satyabh&#257;m&#257;, one of Krishna's queens, wanted that lotus flower, and Krishna promised to deliver it; but Indra refused to part with his p&#257;rij&#257;ta flower. Therefore there was a great fight, with Krishna and the P&#257;ndavas on one side and all of the demigods on the other. Ultimately, Krishna defeated all of them and took the p&#257;rij&#257;ta flower, which He presented to His queen. So, in regard to that occurrence, Krishna told N&#257;rada Muni, "My dear great sage of the demigods, now you can declare to the devotees in general, and to the nondevotees in particular, that in this matter of taking the p&#257;rij&#257;ta flower, all the demigods &#8212; the Gandharvas, the N&#257;gas, the demon R&#257;kshasas, the Yakshas, the Pannagas &#8212; tried to defeat Me, but none could make Me break My promise to My queen."</P><P>There is another promise by Krishna in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; to the effect that His devotee will never be vanquished. So a sincere devotee who is always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord should know for certain that Krishna will never break His promise. He will always protect His devotees in every circumstance.</P><P>Krishna showed how He fulfills His promise by delivering the p&#257;rij&#257;ta flower to Satyabh&#257;m&#257;, by saving Draupad&#299; from being insulted and by freeing Arjuna from the attacks of all enemies.</P><P>The promise of Krishna that His devotees are never vanquished had also previously been admitted by Indra when he was defeated in the govardhana-l&#299;l&#257;. When Krishna stopped the villagers of Vraja (Vrind&#257;vana) from worshiping Indra, Indra became angry and therefore inundated Vrind&#257;vana with continuous rain. Krishna, however, protected all of the citizens and animals of Vrind&#257;vana by lifting Govardhana Hill, which served as an umbrella. After the incident was over, Indra surrendered to Krishna with many prayers, in which he admitted, "By Your lifting Govardhana Hill and protecting the citizens of Vrind&#257;vana, You have kept Your promise that Your devotees are never to be vanquished."</P><P>19. Expert Judge of Time and Circumstances</P><P>Krishna was very expert in dealing with people according to circumstances, country, time and paraphernalia. How He could take advantage of a particular time, circumstance and person is expressed by Him while talking to Uddhava about His r&#257;sa dance with the gop&#299;s. He says, "The most opportune time is the full-moon night in autumn, like tonight. The best place within the universe is Vrind&#257;vana, and the most beautiful girls are the gop&#299;s. So, My dear friend Uddhava, I think I should now take advantage of all these circumstances and engage Myself in the r&#257;sa dance."</P><P>20. Seer by the Authority of the Scriptures</P><P>A person who acts exactly according to the tenets of scripture is called &#347;&#257;stra-cakshus. &#346;&#257;stra-cakshus means one who sees through the eyes of the authorized scriptures. Actually, any man of knowledge and experience should see everything through these books. For example, with our naked eye we perceive the sun globe simply as some glaring substance, but when we see through authorized books of science and other literature, we can understand how much greater the sun globe is than this earth and how powerful it is. So seeing things through the naked eye is not actually seeing. Seeing things through the authorized books or authorized teachers is the correct way to see. So, although Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can see all that is past, present and future, to teach the people in general He used to always refer to the scriptures. For example, in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, although Krishna was speaking as the supreme authority, He still mentioned and quoted Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra as authority. There is a statement in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam wherein a person jokingly says that Krishna, the enemy of Kamsa, is known as the seer through the &#347;&#257;stras. In order to establish His authority, however, He is now engaged in seeing the gop&#299;s, whereby the gop&#299;s are becoming maddened.</P><P>21. Pure</P><P>There are two kinds of supreme purity. When one type is possessed, one is able to deliver a sinful person. When the other type is possessed, one does not do anything which is impure. A person who possesses either of these qualities is called supremely pure. Krishna is both; He can deliver all sinful conditioned souls, and at the same time, He never does anything by which He can be contaminated.</P><P>In this connection, Vidura, while trying to detach his elder brother, Dhritar&#257;shtra, from his familial attachments, said, "My dear brother, you just fix your mind on the lotus feet of Krishna, who is worshiped with beautiful, erudite verses by great sages and saintly persons. Krishna is the supreme deliverer among all deliverers. Undoubtedly there are great demigods like Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257;, but their positions as deliverers depend always upon the mercy of Krishna." Therefore Vidura advised his elder brother, Dhritar&#257;shtra, to concentrate his mind and worship only Krishna. If one simply chants the holy name of Krishna, this holy name will rise within one's heart like the powerful sun and will immediately dissipate all the darkness of ignorance. Vidura advised Dhritar&#257;shtra to therefore think always of Krishna, so that the volumes of contaminations due to sinful activities would be washed off immediately. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; also Krishna is addressed by Arjuna as param brahma param dh&#257;ma pavitram [<A CLASS=v HREF="../bg/10/12.htm">Bg. 10.12</A>] &#8212; the supreme pure. There are many other instances exhibiting Krishna's supreme purity.</P><P>22. Self-controlled</P><P>A person who can control his senses fully is called va&#347;&#299;, or self-controlled. In this connection it is stated in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, "All the sixteen thousand wives of Krishna were so exquisitely beautiful that their smiling and shyness were able to captivate the minds of great demigods like Lord &#346;iva. But still they could not even agitate the mind of Krishna, in spite of their attractive feminine behavior." Every one of the thousands of wives of Krishna was thinking that Krishna was captivated by her feminine beauty, but this was not the case. Krishna is therefore the supreme controller of the senses, and this is admitted in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, where He is addressed as Hrish&#299;ke&#347;a &#8212; the master of the senses.</P><P>23. Steadfast</P><P>A person who continues to work until his desired goal is achieved is called steadfast.</P><P>There was a fight between Krishna and King J&#257;mbav&#257;n, and Krishna was to take the valuable Syamantaka jewel from the King. The King tried to hide himself in the forest, but Krishna would not become discouraged. Krishna finally got the jewel by seeking out the King with great steadfastness.</P><P>24. Forbearing</P><P>A person who tolerates all kinds of troubles, even though such troubles appear to be unbearable, is called forbearing.</P><P>When Krishna was residing at the place of His spiritual master, He did not mind taking all troubles in rendering service to His guru, although His body was very soft and delicate. It is the duty of the disciple to execute all services unto the spiritual master, despite all kinds of difficulties. The disciple living at the residence of the spiritual master has to go begging from door to door and bring everything back to the spiritual master. When pras&#257;da is being served, the spiritual master is supposed to call each and every disciple to come eat. If by chance the spiritual master forgets to call a disciple to partake of the pras&#257;da, it is enjoined in the scriptures that the student should fast on that day rather than accept food on his own initiative. There are many such strictures. Sometimes, also, Krishna went to the forest to collect dry wood for fuel.</P><P>25. Forgiving</P><P>A person who can tolerate all kinds of offenses from the opposite party is known to be forgiving.</P><P>Lord Krishna's forgiving quality is described in the &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la-vadha in connection with His forbidding the killing of &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la. King &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la was the monarch of the Cedi kingdom, and although he happened to be a cousin of Krishna's, he was always envious of Him. Whenever they would meet, &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la would try to insult Krishna and call Him ill names as much as possible. In the arena of the R&#257;jas&#363;ya sacrifice of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira, when &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la began to call Lord Krishna ill names, Krishna did not care and remained silent. Some of the people at the arena were prepared to kill &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, but Krishna restricted them. He was so forgiving. It is said that when there is a thundering sound in the clouds, the mighty lion immediately replies with his thundering roar. But the lion doesn't care when all the foolish jackals begin to make their less important sounds.</P><P>&#346;r&#299; Y&#257;mun&#257;c&#257;rya praises Krishna's power of forgiveness with the following statement: "My dear Lord R&#257;macandra, You are so merciful to have excused the crow's clawing on the nipples of J&#257;nak&#299; simply because of his bowing down before You." Once Indra, the King of heaven, assumed the form of a crow and attacked S&#299;t&#257; (J&#257;nak&#299;), Lord R&#257;macandra's wife, by striking her on the breast. This was certainly an insult to the universal mother, S&#299;t&#257;, and Lord R&#257;macandra was immediately prepared to kill the crow. But because later on the crow bowed down before the Lord, the Lord excused his offense. &#346;r&#299; Y&#257;mun&#257;c&#257;rya further says in his prayer that the forgiving power of Lord Krishna is even greater than that of Lord R&#257;macandra, because &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la was always in the habit of insulting Krishna &#8212; not only in one lifetime, but continually throughout three lives. Still, Krishna was so kind that He gave &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la the salvation of merging into His existence. From this we can understand that the goal of the monist to merge into the effulgence of the Supreme is not a very difficult problem. Persons like &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la who are consistently inimical to Krishna can also get this liberation.</P><P>26. Grave</P><P>A person who does not express his mind to everyone, or whose mental activity and plan of action are very difficult to understand, is called grave. After Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna had been offended by Brahm&#257;, Brahm&#257; prayed to Him to be excused. But in spite of his offering nice prayers to Krishna, Brahm&#257; could not understand whether Krishna was satisfied or still dissatisfied. In other words, Krishna was so grave that He did not take the prayers of Brahm&#257; very seriously. Another instance of Krishna's gravity is found in connection with His love affairs with R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;. Krishna was always very silent about His love affairs with R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;, so much so that Baladeva, Krishna's elder brother and constant companion, could not understand the transformations of Krishna on account of His gravity.</P><P>27. Self-satisfied</P><P>A person who is fully satisfied in himself, without any hankering, and who is not agitated even in the presence of serious cause for distress, is called self-satisfied.</P><P>An example of Krishna's self-satisfaction was exhibited when He, Arjuna and Bh&#299;ma went to challenge Jar&#257;sandha, the formidable king of Magadha, and Krishna gave all credit to Bh&#299;ma for the killing of Jar&#257;sandha. From this we can understand that Krishna never cares at all for fame, although no one can be more famous.</P><P>An example of His not being disturbed was shown when &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la began to call Him ill names. All the kings and br&#257;hmanas assembled at the sacrificial arena of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhishthira became perturbed and immediately wanted to satisfy Krishna by offering nice prayers. But all these kings and br&#257;hmanas could not discover any disturbance in Krishna's person.</P><P>28. Possessing Equilibrium</P><P>A person who is unaffected by attachment and envy is said to possess equilibrium.</P><P>An example of Krishna's equilibrium is given in the Tenth Canto, Sixteenth Chapter, verse 33, of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam in connection with His chastising K&#257;liya, the hundred-headed serpent. While K&#257;liya was being severely punished, all of his wives appeared before the Lord and prayed as follows: "Dear Lord, You have descended to punish all kinds of demoniac living creatures. Our husband, this K&#257;liya, is a greatly sinful creature, and so Your punishment for him is quite appropriate. We know that Your punishment for Your enemies and Your dealings with Your sons are both the same. We know that it is in thinking of the future welfare of this condemned creature that You have chastised him."</P><P>In another prayer it is said, "My dear Lord Krishna, best of all the Kuru dynasty, You are so impartial that if even Your enemy is qualified, You will reward him; and if one of Your sons is a culprit, You will chastise him. This is Your business, because You are the supreme author of the universes. You have no partiality. If anyone finds any partiality in Your characteristics, he is surely mistaken."</P><P>29. Magnanimous</P><P>Any person who is very charitably disposed is called magnanimous.</P><P>When Krishna was reigning over Dv&#257;rak&#257;, He was so magnanimous and charitably disposed that there was no limit to His charity. In fact, so great was His charity in Dv&#257;rak&#257; that even the spiritual kingdom, with all of its opulence of cint&#257;mani (touchstone), desire trees and surabhi cows, was surpassed. In the spiritual kingdom of Lord Krishna, named Goloka Vrind&#257;vana, there are surabhi cows which give unlimited quantities of milk. There are desire trees from which anyone can take all kinds of fruits, as much as he may desire. The land is made of touchstone, which when touched to iron will transform it into gold. In other words, although in the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Krishna, everything is wonderfully opulent, still when Krishna was in Dv&#257;rak&#257; His charity exceeded the opulences of Goloka Vrind&#257;vana. Wherever Krishna is present, the limitless opulence of Goloka Vrind&#257;vana is automatically present.</P><P>It is also stated that while Lord Krishna was living in Dv&#257;rak&#257;, He expanded Himself into 16,108 forms, and each and every expansion resided in a palace with a queen. Not only was Krishna happily living with His queens in those palaces, but He was giving in charity from each palace an aggregate number of 13,054 cows completely decorated with nice clothing and ornaments. From each of Krishna's 16,108 palaces, these cows were being given in charity by Krishna every day. No one can estimate the value of such a large number of cows given in charity, but that was the system of Krishna's daily affairs while He was reigning in Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</P><P>30. Religious</P><P>A person who personally practices the tenets of religion as they are enjoined in the &#347;&#257;stras and who also teaches others the same principles is called religious. Simply professing a kind of faith is not a sign of religiousness. One must act according to religious principles, and by his personal example he should teach others. Such a person is to be understood as religious.</P><P>When Krishna was present on this planet, there was no irreligion. In this connection, N&#257;rada Muni once addressed Krishna jokingly, "My dear Lord of the cowherd boys, Your bulls [bulls are the representation of religion], while eating grass from the pasturing ground and moving on their four legs, have certainly eaten up all the grass of irreligion!" In other words, by the grace of Krishna, religious principles were so well cared for that hardly any irreligious activities could be found.</P><P>It is said that because Krishna was constantly performing various types of sacrifices and was inviting the demigods from the higher planetary systems, the demigods were almost always absent from their consorts. Therefore the wives of the demigods, regretting the absence of their husbands, began to pray for the appearance of Lord Buddha, Krishna's ninth incarnation, who appears in the age of Kali. In other words, instead of being pleased that Lord Krishna had come, they began to pray for Lord Buddha, who is the ninth incarnation, because Lord Buddha stopped the ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices recommended in the Vedas in order to discourage animal-killing. The demigods' wives thought that if Lord Buddha appeared, all kinds of sacrifices would be stopped, and thus their husbands would not be invited to such ceremonies and would not be separated from them.</P><P>Sometimes it is inquired, "Why don't the demigods from higher planetary systems come to this earth planet nowadays?" The plain answer is that since Lord Buddha appeared and began to deprecate the performance of sacrifice in order to stop animal-killing on this planet, the process of offering sacrifices has been stopped, and the demigods do not care to come here anymore.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=378"><IMG SRC="../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
