His limbs are beautiful, and His body, smeared with the pulp of sandalwood, seems like molten gold. In His later pastimes He accepts the sanny&#257;sa order, and He is equipoised and peaceful. He is the highest abode of peace and devotion, for He silences the impersonalist nondevotees."</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>This is a verse from the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata (D&#257;na-dharma, Vishnu-sahasra-n&#257;ma-stotra). In his commentary on the Vishnu-sahasra-n&#257;ma, called the N&#257;m&#257;rtha-sudh&#257;, &#346;r&#299;la Baladeva Vidy&#257;bh&#363;shana, commenting upon this verse, asserts that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the evidence of the Upanishads. He explains that suvarna-varnah means a golden complexion. He also quotes the Vedic injunction yad&#257; pa&#347;yah pa&#347;yate rukma-varnam kart&#257;ram &#299;&#347;am purusham brahma-yonim (Mundaka Up. 3.1.3). Rukma-varnam kart&#257;ram &#299;&#347;am refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead as having a complexion the color of molten gold. Purusham means the Supreme Lord, and brahma-yonim indicates that He is also the Supreme Brahman. This evidence, too, proves that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. Another meaning of the description of the Lord as having a golden hue is that Lord Caitanya's personality is as fascinating as gold is attractive. &#346;r&#299;la Baladeva Vidy&#257;bh&#363;shana has explained that the word var&#257;&#324;ga means "exquisitely beautiful."</P><P>Lord Caitanya accepted sanny&#257;sa, leaving aside His householder life, to preach His mission. He has equanimity in different senses. First, He describes the confidential truth of the Personality of Godhead, and second, He satisfies everyone by knowledge and attachment to Krishna. He is peaceful because He renounces all topics not related to the service of Krishna. &#346;r&#299;la Baladeva Vidy&#257;bh&#363;shana has explained that the word nishth&#257; indicates His being rigidly fixed in chanting the holy name of &#346;r&#299; Krishna. Lord Caitanya subdued all disturbing opponents of devotional service, especially the monists, who are actually averse to the personal feature of the Supreme Lord.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
