The authentic scriptures describe the transcendental activities, features, form and qualities of Krishna, and Krishna explains Himself in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, the most authentic scripture in the world. He is further explained in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, which is considered the explanation of the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra. Lord Krishna is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by these authentic scriptures, not simply by vox populi. In the modern age a certain class of fools think that they can vote anyone into the position of God, as they can vote a man into the position of a political executive head. But the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead is perfectly described in the authentic scriptures. In the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; the Lord says that only fools deride Him, thinking that anyone can speak like Krishna.</P><P>Even according to historical references, Krishna's activities are most uncommon. Krishna has affirmed, "I am God," and He has acted accordingly. M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s think that everyone can claim to be God, but that is their illusion, for no one else can perform such extraordinary activities as Krishna. When He was a child on the lap of His mother, He killed the demon P&#363;tan&#257;. Then He killed the demons Trin&#257;varta, Vats&#257;sura and Baka. When He was a little more grown up, He killed the demons Agh&#257;sura and Rishabh&#257;sura. Therefore God is God from the very beginning. The idea that someone can become God by meditation is ridiculous. By hard endeavor one may realize his godly nature, but he will never become God. The asuras, or demons, who think that anyone can become God, are condemned.</P><P>The authentic scriptures are compiled by personalities like Vy&#257;sadeva, N&#257;rada, Asita and Par&#257;&#347;ara, who are not ordinary men. All the followers of the Vedic way of life have accepted these famous personalities, whose authentic scriptures conform to the Vedic literature. Nevertheless, the demoniac do not believe their statements, and they purposely oppose the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees. Today it is fashionable for common men to write whimsical words as so-called incarnations of God and be accepted as authentic by other common men. This demoniac mentality is condemned in the Seventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, wherein it is said that those who are miscreants and the lowest of mankind, who are fools and asses, cannot accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead because of their demoniac nature. They are compared to ul&#363;kas, or owls, who cannot open their eyes in the sunlight. Because they cannot bear the sunlight, they hide themselves from it and never see it. They cannot believe that there is such illumination.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="86.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="88.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
