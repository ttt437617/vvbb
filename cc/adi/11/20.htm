Sometimes in his ecstasy he would slap the cheek of a tiger, and sometimes he would play with a venomous snake.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Th&#257;kura writes in his Anubh&#257;shya, "Mur&#257;ri Caitanya d&#257;sa was born in the village of Sar-vrind&#257;vana-pura, which is situated about two miles from the Gala&#347;&#299; station on the Burdwan line. When Mur&#257;ri Caitanya d&#257;sa came to Navadv&#299;pa, he settled in the village of Modadruma, or M&#257;mag&#257;chi-gr&#257;ma. At that time he became known as &#346;&#257;r&#324;ga or S&#257;ra&#324;ga Mur&#257;ri Caitanya d&#257;sa. The descendants of his family still reside in Sarer P&#257;ta. In the Caitanya-bh&#257;gavata, Antya-khanda, Chapter Five, there is the following statement: 'Mur&#257;ri Caitanya d&#257;sa had no material bodily features, for he was completely spiritual. Thus he would sometimes chase after tigers in the jungle and treat them just like cats and dogs. He would slap the cheek of a tiger and take a venomous snake on his lap. He had no fear for his external body, of which he was completely forgetful. He could spend all twenty-four hours of the day chanting the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra or speaking about Lord Caitanya and Nity&#257;nanda. Sometimes he would remain submerged in water for two or three days, but he would feel no bodily inconvenience. Thus he behaved almost like stone or wood, but he always used his energy in chanting the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra. No one can describe his specific characteristics, but it is understood that wherever Mur&#257;ri Caitanya d&#257;sa passed, whoever was present would be enlightened in Krishna consciousness simply by the atmosphere he created.'"</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
