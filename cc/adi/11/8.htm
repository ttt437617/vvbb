His real mother was Vasudh&#257;. In the Gaura-ganodde&#347;a-d&#299;pik&#257; (67) he is mentioned as an incarnation of Ksh&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vishnu. Therefore V&#299;rabhadra Gos&#257;ñi is nondifferent from &#346;r&#299; Krishna Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. In a village of the name Jh&#257;matapura, in the district of Hugli, V&#299;rabhadra Gos&#257;ñi had a disciple named Yadun&#257;th&#257;c&#257;rya, who had two daughters &#8212; a real daughter named &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; and a foster daughter named N&#257;r&#257;yan&#299;. Both these daughters married, and they are mentioned in the Bhakti-ratn&#257;kara (Thirteenth Wave). V&#299;rabhadra Gos&#257;ñi had three disciples who are celebrated as his sons &#8212; Gop&#299;jana-vallabha, R&#257;makrishna and R&#257;macandra. The youngest, R&#257;macandra, belonged to the &#346;&#257;ndilya dynasty and had the surname Vatavy&#257;la. He established his family at Khadadaha, and its members are known as the gosv&#257;m&#299;s of Khadadaha. The eldest disciple, Gop&#299;jana-vallabha, was a resident of a village known as Lat&#257;, near the M&#257;nakara railway station in the district of Burdwan. The second, R&#257;makrishna, lived near M&#257;ladaha, in a village named Gaye&#347;apura." &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Th&#257;kura notes that since these three disciples belonged to different gotras, or dynasties, and also had different surnames and lived in different places, it is not possible to accept them as real sons of V&#299;rabhadra Gos&#257;ñi. R&#257;macandra had four sons, of whom the eldest was R&#257;dh&#257;m&#257;dhava, whose third son was named Y&#257;davendra. Y&#257;davendra's son was Nandaki&#347;ora, his son was Nidhikrishna, his son was Caitanyac&#257;nda, his son was Krishnamohana, his son was Jaganmohana, his son was Vrajan&#257;tha, and his son was &#346;y&#257;mal&#257;la Gosv&#257;m&#299;. This is the genealogical table given by Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Th&#257;kura for the descendants of V&#299;rabhadra Gos&#257;ñi.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
