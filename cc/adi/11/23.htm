Lord Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu perceived the life of Vrajabh&#363;mi in his company.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Th&#257;kura writes in his Anubh&#257;shya, "In the Caitanya-bh&#257;gavata, Antya-khanda, Chapter Five, it is stated that Sundar&#257;nanda was an ocean of love of Godhead and the chief associate of &#346;r&#299; Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu. In the Gaura-ganodde&#347;a-d&#299;pik&#257; (127) he is stated to have been Sud&#257;m&#257; in krishna-l&#299;l&#257;. Thus he was one of the twelve cowherd boys who came down with Balar&#257;ma when He descended as &#346;r&#299; Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu. The holy place where Sundar&#257;nanda lived is situated in the village known as Mahe&#347;apura, which is about fourteen miles east of the M&#257;jadiy&#257; railway station of the eastern railway from Calcutta to Burdwan. This place is within the district of Jessore, [which is now in Bangladesh]. Among the relics of this village, only the old residential house of Sundar&#257;nanda still exists. At the end of the village resides a b&#257;ula [pseudo Vaishnava], and all the buildings, both the temples and the house, appear to be newly constructed. In Mahe&#347;apura there are Deities of &#346;r&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;vallabha and &#346;r&#299; &#346;r&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;ramana. Near the temple is a small river of the name Vetravat&#299;.</P><P>"Sundar&#257;nanda Prabhu was a naishthika-brahmac&#257;r&#299;: he never married in his life. Therefore he had no direct descendants except his disciples, but the descendants of his family still reside in the village known as Ma&#324;galadihi in the district of Birbhum. In that same village is a temple of Balar&#257;ma, and the Deity there is regularly worshiped. The original Deity of Mahe&#347;apura, R&#257;dh&#257;vallabha, was taken by the Said&#257;b&#257;d Gosv&#257;m&#299;s of Berhampur, and since the present Deities were installed, a zamindar family of Mahe&#347;apura has looked after Their worship. On the full-moon day of the month of M&#257;gha (January-February), the anniversary of Sundar&#257;nanda's disappearance is regularly celebrated, and people from the neighboring areas gather together to observe this festival."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
