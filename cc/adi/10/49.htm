His great humility and meekness melted the heart of Lord Caitanya.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299; Mur&#257;ri Gupta wrote a book called &#346;r&#299; Caitanya-carita. He belonged to a vaidya physician family of &#346;r&#299;hatta, the paternal home of Lord Caitanya, and later became a resident of Navadv&#299;pa. He was among the elders of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. Lord Caitanya exhibited His Var&#257;ha form in the house of Mur&#257;ri Gupta, as described in the Caitanya-bh&#257;gavata, Madhya-khanda, Third Chapter. When &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu exhibited His mah&#257;-prak&#257;&#347;a form, He appeared before Mur&#257;ri Gupta as Lord R&#257;macandra. When &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu were sitting together in the house of &#346;r&#299;v&#257;sa Th&#257;kura, Mur&#257;ri Gupta first offered his respects to Lord Caitanya and then to &#346;r&#299; Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu. Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu, however, was older than Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, and therefore Lord Caitanya remarked that Mur&#257;ri Gupta had violated social etiquette, for he should have first shown respect to Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu and then to Him. In this way, by the grace of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, Mur&#257;ri Gupta was informed about the position of &#346;r&#299; Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu, and the next day he offered obeisances first to Lord Nity&#257;nanda and then to Lord Caitanya. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu gave chewed pan, or betel nut, to Mur&#257;ri Gupta. Once &#346;iv&#257;nanda Sena offered food to Lord Caitanya that had been cooked with excessive ghee, and the next day the Lord became sick and went to Mur&#257;ri Gupta for treatment. Lord Caitanya accepted some water from the waterpot of Mur&#257;ri Gupta, and thus He was cured. The natural remedy for indigestion is to drink a little water, and since Mur&#257;ri Gupta was a physician, he gave the Lord some drinking water and cured Him.</P><P>When Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu appeared in the house of &#346;r&#299;v&#257;sa Th&#257;kura in His Caturbhuja m&#363;rti, Mur&#257;ri Gupta became His carrier in the form of Garuda, and in these pastimes of ecstasy the Lord then got up on his back. It was the desire of Mur&#257;ri Gupta to leave his body before the disappearance of Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, but the Lord forbade him to do so. This is described in the Caitanya-bh&#257;gavata, Madhya-khanda, Chapter Twenty. When &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu one day appeared in ecstasy as the Var&#257;ha m&#363;rti, Mur&#257;ri Gupta offered Him prayers. He was a great devotee of Lord R&#257;macandra, and his staunch devotion is vividly described in the Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita, Madhya-l&#299;l&#257;, Fifteenth Chapter, verses 137 through 157.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
