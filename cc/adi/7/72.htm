'You are not qualified to study Ved&#257;nta philosophy, and therefore You must always chant the holy name of Krishna. This is the essence of all mantras, or Vedic hymns.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299; Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Gosv&#257;m&#299; Mah&#257;r&#257;ja comments in this connection, "One can become perfectly successful in the mission of his life if he acts exactly according to the words he hears from the mouth of his spiritual master." This acceptance of the words of the spiritual master is called &#347;rauta-v&#257;kya, which indicates that the disciple must carry out the spiritual master's instructions without deviation. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; Th&#257;kura remarks in this connection that a disciple must accept the words of his spiritual master as his life and soul. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu here confirms this by saying that since His spiritual master ordered Him only to chant the holy name of Krishna, He always chanted the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra according to this direction ('krishna-mantra' japa sad&#257;, &#8212; ei mantra-s&#257;ra).</P><P>Krishna is the origin of everything. Therefore when a person is fully Krishna conscious it is to be understood that his relationship with Krishna has been fully confirmed. Lacking Krishna consciousness, one is only partially related with Krishna and is therefore not in his constitutional position. Although &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna, the spiritual master of the entire universe, He nevertheless took the position of a disciple in order to teach by example how a devotee should strictly follow the orders of a spiritual master in executing the duty of always chanting the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra. One who is very much attracted to the study of Ved&#257;nta philosophy must take lessons from &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. In this age, no one is actually competent to study Ved&#257;nta, and therefore it is better that one chant the holy name of the Lord, which is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, as Krishna Himself confirms in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">15.15</A>):</P><P>vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedyo</P><P CLASS=n>ved&#257;nta-krid veda-vid eva c&#257;ham</P><P>"By all the Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of Ved&#257;nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas."</P><P>Only fools give up the service of the spiritual master and think themselves advanced in spiritual knowledge. In order to check such fools, Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu Himself presented the perfect example of how to be a disciple. A spiritual master knows very well how to engage each disciple in a particular duty, but if a disciple, thinking himself more advanced than his spiritual master, gives up his orders and acts independently, he checks his own spiritual progress. Every disciple must consider himself completely unaware of the science of Krishna and must always be ready to carry out the orders of the spiritual master to become competent in Krishna consciousness. A disciple should always remain a fool before his spiritual master. Therefore sometimes pseudo spiritualists accept a spiritual master who is not even fit to become a disciple because they want to keep him under their control. This is useless for spiritual realization.</P><P>One who imperfectly knows Krishna consciousness cannot know Ved&#257;nta philosophy. A showy display of Ved&#257;nta study without Krishna consciousness is a feature of the external energy, m&#257;y&#257;, and as long as one is attracted by the inebrieties of this ever-changing material energy, he deviates from devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. An actual follower of Ved&#257;nta philosophy is a devotee of Lord Vishnu, who is the greatest of the great and the maintainer of the entire universe. Unless one surpasses the field of activities in service to the limited, one cannot reach the unlimited. Knowledge of the unlimited is actual brahma-jñ&#257;na, or knowledge of the Supreme. Those who are addicted to fruitive activities and speculative knowledge cannot understand the value of the holy name of Lord Krishna, which is always completely pure, eternally liberated and full of spiritual bliss. One who has taken shelter of the holy name of the Lord, which is identical with the Lord, does not have to study Ved&#257;nta philosophy, for he has already completed all such study.</P><P>One who is unfit to chant the holy name of Krishna but thinks that the holy name is different from Krishna and thus takes shelter of Ved&#257;nta study in order to understand Him must be considered a number one fool, as confirmed by Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu by His personal behavior, and philosophical speculators who want to make Ved&#257;nta philosophy an academic career are also considered to be within the material energy. A person who always chants the holy name of the Lord, however, is already beyond the ocean of nescience, and thus even a person born in a low family who engages in chanting the holy name of the Lord is considered to be beyond the study of Ved&#257;nta philosophy. In this connection &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/3/33/7.htm">3.33.7</A>) states:</P><P>aho bata &#347;va-paco 'to gar&#299;y&#257;n</P><P CLASS=n>yaj-jihv&#257;gre vartate n&#257;ma tubhyam</P><P CLASS=n>tepus tapas te juhuvuh sasnur &#257;ry&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>brahm&#257;n&#363;cur n&#257;ma grinanti ye te</P><P>"If a person born in a family of dog-eaters takes to the chanting of the holy name of Krishna, it is to be understood that in his previous life he must have executed all kinds of austerities and penances and performed all the Vedic yajñas." Another quotation states:</P><P>rig-vedo 'tha yajur-vedah s&#257;ma-vedo 'py atharvanah</P><P CLASS=n>adh&#299;t&#257;s tena yenoktam harir ity akshara-dvayam</P><P>"A person who chants the two syllables ha-ri has already studied the four Vedas &#8212; S&#257;ma, Rig, Yajur and Atharva."</P><P>Taking advantage of these verses, there are some sahajiy&#257;s who, taking everything very cheaply, consider themselves elevated Vaishnavas but do not care even to touch the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra or Ved&#257;nta philosophy. A real Vaishnava should, however, study Ved&#257;nta philosophy, but if after studying Ved&#257;nta one does not adopt the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, he is no better than a M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;. Therefore, one should not be a M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;, yet one should not be unaware of the subject matter of Ved&#257;nta philosophy. Indeed, Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu exhibited His knowledge of Ved&#257;nta in His discourses with Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299;. Thus it is to be understood that a Vaishnava should be completely conversant with Ved&#257;nta philosophy, yet he should not think that studying Ved&#257;nta is all in all and therefore be unattached to the chanting of the holy name. A devotee must know the importance of simultaneously understanding Ved&#257;nta philosophy and chanting the holy names. If by studying Ved&#257;nta one becomes an impersonalist, he has not been able to understand Ved&#257;nta. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">15.15</A>). Ved&#257;nta means "the end of knowledge." The ultimate end of knowledge is knowledge of Krishna, who is identical with His holy name. Cheap Vaishnavas (sahajiy&#257;s) do not care to study the Ved&#257;nta philosophy as commented upon by the four &#257;c&#257;ryas. In the Gaud&#299;ya-samprad&#257;ya there is a Ved&#257;nta commentary called the Govinda-bh&#257;shya, but the sahajiy&#257;s consider such commentaries to be untouchable philosophical speculation, and they consider the &#257;c&#257;ryas to be mixed devotees. Thus they clear their way to hell.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="71.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="73.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
