There is no greater blasphemy against the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299; Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Gosv&#257;m&#299; explains that the variegated personal feature of the Absolute Truth is the vishnu-tattva and that the material energy, which creates this cosmic manifestation, is the energy of Lord Vishnu. The creative force is merely the energy of the Lord, but the foolish conclude that because the Lord has distributed Himself in an impersonal form He has no separate existence. The impersonal Brahman, however, cannot possess energies, nor do the Vedic literatures state that m&#257;y&#257; (the illusory energy) is covered by another m&#257;y&#257;. There are hundreds and thousands of references, however, to vishnu-m&#257;y&#257; (par&#257;sya &#347;aktih), or the energy of Lord Vishnu. In the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/14.htm">7.14</A>) Krishna refers to mama m&#257;y&#257; ("My energy"). M&#257;y&#257; is controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; it is not that He is covered by m&#257;y&#257;. Therefore Lord Vishnu cannot be a product of the material energy. In the beginning of the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra it is said, janm&#257;dy asya yatah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/1/1.htm">SB 1.1.1</A>], indicating that the material energy is also an emanation of the Supreme Brahman. How then could He be covered by the material energy? If that were possible, material energy would be greater than the Supreme Brahman. Even these simple arguments, however, cannot be understood by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers, and therefore the term m&#257;yay&#257;pahrita-jñ&#257;na, which is applied to them in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, is extremely appropriate. Anyone who thinks that Lord Vishnu is a product of the material energy, as explained by Sad&#257;nanda Yog&#299;ndra, should immediately be understood to be insane, for his knowledge has been stolen by the illusory energy.</P><P>Lord Vishnu cannot be placed within the category of the demigods. Those who are actually bewildered by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy and are still in the darkness of ignorance consider Lord Vishnu to be a demigod, in defiance of the Rig-vedic mantra om tad vishnoh paramam padam ("Vishnu is always in a superior position"). This mantra is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;: mattah parataram n&#257;nyat [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/7.htm">Bg. 7.7</A>] &#8212; there is no truth superior to Lord Krishna, or Vishnu. Thus only those whose knowledge has been bewildered consider Lord Vishnu to be a demigod and therefore suggest that one may worship either Lord Vishnu, the goddess K&#257;l&#299; (Durg&#257;) or whomever one likes and achieve the same result. This is an ignorant conclusion that is not accepted in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/25.htm">9.25</A>), which distinctly says, y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n . . . y&#257;nti mad-y&#257;jino 'pi m&#257;m: The worshipers of the demigods will be promoted to the respective planets of the demigods, but devotees of the Supreme Lord will go back home, back to Godhead. Lord Krishna explains very clearly in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/14.htm">7.14</A>) that His material energy is very difficult to overcome: daiv&#299; hy esh&#257; guna-may&#299; mama m&#257;y&#257; duratyay&#257;. M&#257;y&#257;'s influence is so strong that even learned scholars and spiritualists are also covered by m&#257;y&#257; and think themselves to be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually, however, to free oneself from the influence of m&#257;y&#257; one must surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as Krishna also states in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/14.htm">7.14</A>): m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;m taranti te. It is to be concluded, therefore, that Lord Vishnu does not belong to this material creation but to the spiritual world. To misconceive Lord Vishnu to have a material body or to equate Him with the demigods is the most offensive blasphemy against Lord Vishnu, and offenders against the lotus feet of Lord Vishnu cannot advance in spiritual knowledge. They are called m&#257;yay&#257;pahrita-jñ&#257;na, or those whose knowledge has been stolen by the influence of illusion.</P><P>One who thinks that there is a difference between Lord Vishnu's body and His soul dwells in the darkest region of ignorance. There is no difference between Lord Vishnu's body and Vishnu's soul, for they are advaya-jñ&#257;na, one knowledge. In this world there is a difference between the material body and the spiritual soul, but in the spiritual world everything is spiritual and there are no such differences. The greatest offense of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers is to consider Lord Vishnu and the living entities to be one and the same. In this connection the Padma Pur&#257;na states, arcye vishnau &#347;il&#257;-dhir gurushu nara-matir vaishnave j&#257;ti-buddhih . . yasya v&#257; n&#257;rak&#299; sah: "One who considers the arc&#257;-m&#363;rti, the worshipable Deity of Lord Vishnu, to be stone, the spiritual master to be an ordinary human being, and a Vaishnava to belong to a particular caste or creed is possessed of hellish intelligence." One who follows such conclusions is doomed.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="114.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="116.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
