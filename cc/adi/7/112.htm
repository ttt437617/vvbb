M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy, however, covering His spiritual opulence, advocates the theory of impersonalism.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>It is stated in the Brahma-samhit&#257;, &#299;&#347;varah paramah krishnah sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigrahah [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>]: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, has a spiritual body which is full of knowledge, eternity and bliss." In this material world everyone's body is just the opposite &#8212; temporary, full of ignorance and full of misery. Therefore when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is sometimes described as nir&#257;k&#257;ra, this is to indicate that He does not have a material body like us.</P><P>M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers do not know how it is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is formless. The Supreme Lord does not have a form like ours but has a spiritual form. Not knowing this, M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers simply advocate the onesided view that the Supreme Godhead, or Brahman, is formless (nir&#257;k&#257;ra). In this connection &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda Th&#257;kura offers many quotes from the Vedic literature. If one accepts the real or direct meaning of these Vedic statements, one can understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has a spiritual body (sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/1.htm">Bs. 5.1</A>]).</P><P>In the Brihad-&#257;ranyaka Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/5/1/1">5.1.1</A>) it is said, p&#363;rnam adah p&#363;rnam idam p&#363;rn&#257;t p&#363;rnam udacyate. This indicates that the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is spiritual, for even though He expands in many ways, He remains the same. In the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/8.htm">10.8</A>) the Lord says, aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate: "I am the origin of all. Everything emanates from Me." M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers materialistically think that if the Supreme Truth expands Himself in everything, He must lose His original form. Thus they think that there cannot be any form other than the expansive gigantic body of the Lord. But the Brihad-&#257;ranyaka Upanishad confirms, p&#363;rnam idam p&#363;rn&#257;t p&#363;rnam udacyate: "Although He expands in many ways, He keeps His original personality. His original spiritual body remains as it is." Similarly, elsewhere it is stated, vicitra-&#347;aktih purushah pur&#257;nah: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original person [purusha], has multifarious energies." And the &#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upanishad declares, sa vriksha-k&#257;l&#257;kritibhih paro 'nyo yasm&#257;t prapañcah parivartate 'yam dharm&#257;vaham p&#257;panudam bhage&#347;am: "He is the origin of material creation, and it is due to Him only that everything changes. He is the protector of religion and annihilator of all sinful activities. He is the master of all opulences." (&#346;vet. Up. 6.6) Ved&#257;ham etam purusham mah&#257;ntam &#257;ditya-varnam tamasah parast&#257;t: "Now I understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be the greatest of the great. He is effulgent like the sun and is beyond this material world." (&#346;vet. Up. 3.8) Patim pat&#299;n&#257;m paramam parast&#257;t: "He is the master of all masters, the superior of all superiors." (&#346;vet. Up. 6.7) Mah&#257;n prabhur vai purushah: "He is the supreme master and supreme person." (&#346;vet. Up. 3.12) Par&#257;sya &#347;aktir vividhaiva &#347;r&#363;yate: "We can understand His opulences in different ways." (&#346;vet. Up. 6.8) Similarly, in the Rig Veda it is stated, tad vishnoh paramam padam sad&#257; pa&#347;yanti s&#363;rayah: "Vishnu is the Supreme, and those who are actually learned think only of His lotus feet." In the Pra&#347;na Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/6/3">6.3</A>) it is said, sa &#299;ksh&#257;m cakre: "He glanced over the material creation." In the Aitareya Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/1/1/1">1.1.1-2</A>) it is said, sa aikshata &#8212; "He glanced over the material creation" &#8212; and sa im&#257;l lok&#257;n asrijata &#8212; "He created this entire material world."</P><P>Thus many verses can be quoted from the Upanishads and Vedas which prove that the Supreme Godhead is not impersonal. In the Katha Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/2/2/13">2.2.13</A>) it is also said, nityo nity&#257;n&#257;m cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m eko bah&#363;n&#257;m yo vidadh&#257;ti k&#257;m&#257;n: "He is the supreme eternally conscious person, who maintains all other living entities." From all these Vedic references one can understand that the Absolute Truth is a person and that no one can equal or excel Him. Although there are many foolish M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers who think that they are even greater than Krishna, Krishna is asamaurdhva: no one is equal to or above Him.</P><P>As stated in the &#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upanishad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/3/19">3.19</A>), ap&#257;ni-p&#257;do javano grah&#299;t&#257;. This verse describes the Absolute Truth as having no legs or hands. Although this is an impersonal description, it does not mean that the Absolute Personality of Godhead has no form. He has a spiritual form that is distinct from the forms of matter. In this verse Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu clarifies this distinction.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="111.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="113.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
