In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly." Nevertheless, the author of these instructions, Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, did not tolerate the misbehavior of Jag&#257;i and M&#257;dh&#257;i. When they harmed Lord Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu, He immediately became angry and wanted to kill them, and it was only by the mercy of Lord Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu that they were saved. One should be very meek and humble in his personal transactions, and if insulted a Vaishnava should be tolerant and not angry. But if there is blasphemy against one's guru or another Vaishnava, one should be as angry as fire. This was exhibited by Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. One should not tolerate blasphemy against a Vaishnava but should immediately take one of three actions. If someone blasphemes a Vaishnava, one should stop him with arguments and higher reason. If one is not expert enough to do this he should give up his life on the spot, and if he cannot do this, he must go away. While Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was in Benares or K&#257;&#347;&#299;, the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; sanny&#257;s&#299;s blasphemed Him in many ways because although He was a sanny&#257;s&#299; He was indulging in chanting and dancing. Tapana Mi&#347;ra and Candra&#347;ekhara heard this criticism, and it was intolerable for them because they were great devotees of Lord Caitanya. They could not stop it, however, and therefore they appealed to Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu because this blasphemy was so intolerable that they had decided to give up their lives.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
