In the Katha Upanishad it is said, nityo nity&#257;n&#257;m cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme eternal and the supreme living force. The living entities are also eternal and are also living forces, but they are very minute in quantity, whereas the Supreme Lord is the supreme living force and the supreme eternal. The supreme eternal never accepts a body of a temporary material nature, whereas the living entities, who are part and parcel of the supreme eternal, are prone to do so. Thus according to the Vedic mantras the Supreme Lord is the supreme master of innumerable living entities.</P><P>The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers, however, try to equate the minute living entities with the supreme living entity. Because they recognize no distinctions between them, their philosophy is called Advaita-v&#257;da, or monism. Factually, however, there is a distinction. This verse is especially meant to impart to the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosopher the understanding that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme controller. The supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead, is Krishna Himself, but as a transcendental pastime He has accepted the form of a devotee, Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu.</P><P>As stated in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna comes to this planet exactly like a human being, some rascals consider Him to be one of the ordinary humans. One who thinks in that mistaken way is described as m&#363;dha, or foolish. Therefore one should not foolishly consider Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu to be an ordinary human being. He has accepted the ecstasy of a devotee, but He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since the time of Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, there have been many imitation incarnations of Krishna who cannot understand that Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is Krishna Himself and not an ordinary human being. Less intelligent men create their own "Gods" by advertising a human being as God. This is their mistake. Therefore here the words t&#257;&#324;ra &#347;uddha kalevara warn that Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu's body is not material but purely spiritual. One should not, therefore, accept Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu as an ordinary devotee, although He has assumed the form of a devotee. Yet one must certainly know that although Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because He accepted the ecstasy of a devotee one should not misunderstand His pastimes and place Him in exactly the same position as Krishna. It is for this reason only that when &#346;r&#299; Krishna Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was addressed as Krishna or Vishnu He blocked His ears, not wanting to hear Himself addressed as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is a class of devotees called Gaur&#257;&#324;ga-n&#257;gar&#299;, who stage plays of Krishna's pastimes using a vigraha, or form, of Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. This is a mistake that is technically called ras&#257;bh&#257;sa. While Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is trying to enjoy as a devotee, one should not disturb Him by addressing Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
