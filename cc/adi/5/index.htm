This may be understood by the analogy of the sun and the sunshine, in which Brahman is like the sunshine and Krishna Himself is like the sun."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>CC &#256;di 5.37</B></A>: Thus in the spiritual sky there are varieties of pastimes within the spiritual energy.

Even Ananta cannot describe His glory.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm"><B>CC &#256;di 5.48</B></A>: That Sa&#324;karshana, who is transcendental pure goodness, is a partial expansion of Nity&#257;nanda Balar&#257;ma.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm"><B>CC &#256;di 5.49</B></A>: I have briefly explained the eighth verse.

It supplies the ingredients of the material world.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="59.htm"><B>CC &#256;di 5.59</B></A>: Because prakriti is dull and inert, it cannot actually be the cause of the material world. But Lord Krishna shows His mercy by infusing His energy into the dull, inert material nature.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="60.htm"><B>CC &#256;di 5.60</B></A>: Thus prakriti, by the energy of Lord Krishna, becomes the secondary cause, just as iron becomes red-hot by the energy of fire.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="61.htm"><B>CC &#256;di 5.61</B></A>: Therefore Lord Krishna is the original cause of the cosmic manifestation.
