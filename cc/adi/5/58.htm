One is called pradh&#257;na or prakriti. It supplies the ingredients of the material world.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>M&#257;y&#257;, the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is divided into two parts. M&#257;y&#257; is both the cause of the cosmic manifestation and the agent who supplies its ingredients. As the cause of the cosmic manifestation she is known as m&#257;y&#257;, and as the agent supplying the ingredients of the cosmic manifestation she is known as pradh&#257;na. An explicit description of these divisions of the external energy is given in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/11/24/1.htm">11.24.1-4</A>). Elsewhere in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/10/63/26.htm">10.63.26</A>) the ingredients and cause of the material cosmic manifestation are described as follows:</P><P>k&#257;lo daivam karma j&#299;vah svabh&#257;vo</P><P CLASS=n>dravyam kshetram pr&#257;na &#257;tm&#257; vik&#257;rah</P><P CLASS=n>tat-sa&#324;gh&#257;to b&#299;ja-roha-prav&#257;has</P><P CLASS=n>tvan-m&#257;yaish&#257; tan-nishedham prapadye</P><P>"O my Lord! Time, activity, providence and nature are four parts of the causal aspect [m&#257;y&#257;] of the external energy. The conditioned vital force, the subtle material ingredients called the dravya, and material nature (which is the field of activity where the false ego acts as the soul), as well as the eleven senses and five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether), which are the sixteen ingredients of the body &#8212; these are the ingredient aspect of m&#257;y&#257;. The body is generated from activity, and activity is generated from the body, just as a tree is generated from a seed that is generated from a tree. This reciprocal cause and effect is called m&#257;y&#257;. My dear Lord, You can save me from this cycle of cause and effect. I worship Your lotus feet."</P><P>Although the living entity is primarily related to the causal portion of m&#257;y&#257;, he is nevertheless conducted by the ingredients of m&#257;y&#257;. Three forces work in the causal portion of m&#257;y&#257;: knowledge, desire and activity. The material ingredients are a manifestation of m&#257;y&#257; as pradh&#257;na. In other words, when the three qualities of m&#257;y&#257; are in a dormant stage, they exist as prakriti, avyakta or pradh&#257;na. The word avyakta, referring to the nonmanifested, is another name of pradh&#257;na. In the avyakta stage, material nature is without varieties. Varieties are manifested by the pradh&#257;na portion of m&#257;y&#257;. The word pradh&#257;na is therefore more important than avyakta or prakriti.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="57.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="59.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
