Thus for the good fortune of all, They have appeared on the horizon of Bengal.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The celebrated ancient capital of the Sena dynasty, which was known as Gaudade&#347;a or Gauda, was situated in what is now the modern district of Maldah. Later this capital was transferred to the ninth or central island on the western side of the Ganges at Navadv&#299;pa, which is now known as M&#257;y&#257;pur and was then called Gaudapura. Lord Caitanya appeared there, and Lord Nity&#257;nanda came there and joined Him from the district of Birbhum. They appeared on the horizon of Gaudade&#347;a to spread the science of Krishna consciousness, and it is predicted that as the sun and moon gradually move west, the movement They began five hundred years ago will come to the Western civilizations by Their mercy.</P><P>Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu drive away the five kinds of ignorance of the conditioned souls. In the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Udyoga-parva, Forty-third Chapter, these five kinds of ignorance are described. They are (1) accepting the body to be the self, (2) making material sense gratification one's standard of enjoyment, (3) being anxious due to material identification, (4) lamenting and (5) thinking that there is anything beyond the Absolute Truth. The teachings of Lord Caitanya eradicate these five kinds of ignorance. Whatever one sees or otherwise experiences one should know to be simply an exhibition of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's energy. Everything is a manifestation of Krishna.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="101.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="103.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
