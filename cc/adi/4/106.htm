Thus feelings of pleasure and pain arise constantly therein.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Lord Caitanya's heart was full of the feelings of &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;, and His appearance resembled Hers. Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara has explained His attitude as r&#257;dh&#257;-bh&#257;va-m&#363;rti, the attitude of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;. One who engages in sense gratification on the material platform can hardly understand r&#257;dh&#257;-bh&#257;va, but one who is freed from the demands of sense gratification can understand it. R&#257;dh&#257;-bh&#257;va must be understood from the Gosv&#257;m&#299;s, those who are actually controllers of the senses. From such authorized sources it is to be known that the attitude of &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299; is the highest perfection of conjugal love, which is the highest of the five transcendental mellows, and it is the complete perfection of love of Krishna.</P><P>These transcendental affairs can be understood on two platforms. One is called elevated, and the other is called superelevated. The loving affairs exhibited in Dv&#257;rak&#257; are the elevated form. The superelevated position is reached in the manifestations of the pastimes of Vrind&#257;vana. The attitude of Lord Caitanya is certainly superelevated.</P><P>From the life of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, an intelligent person engaged in pure devotional service can understand that He always felt separation from Krishna within Himself. In that separation He sometimes felt that He had found Krishna and was enjoying the meeting. The significance of this separation and meeting is very specific. If someone tries to understand the exalted position of Lord Caitanya without knowing this, he is sure to misunderstand it. One must first become fully self-realized. Otherwise one may misidentify the Lord as n&#257;gara, or the enjoyer of the damsels of Vraja, thus committing the mistake of ras&#257;bh&#257;sa, or overlapping understanding.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="105.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="107.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
