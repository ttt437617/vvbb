Hearing the people thus protesting, murmuring in great anger, the Kazi would not come out of his home.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The Kazi's order not to perform sa&#324;k&#299;rtana could stand only as long as there was no civil disobedience. Under the leadership of the Supreme Lord, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, the chanters, increasing in number, disobeyed the order of the Kazi. Thousands assembled together and formed parties, chanting the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra and making a tumultuous sound of protest. Thus the Kazi was very much afraid, as naturally one should be under such circumstances.</P><P>In the present day also, people all over the world may join together in the Krishna consciousness movement and protest against the present degraded governments of the world's godless societies, which are based on all kinds of sinful activities. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam states that in the Age of Kali, thieves, rogues and fourth-class people who have neither education nor culture capture the seats of governments to exploit the citizens. This is a symptom of Kali-yuga that has already appeared. People cannot feel secure about their lives and property, yet the so-called governments continue, and government ministers get fat salaries, although they are unable to do anything good for society. The only remedy for such conditions is to enhance the sa&#324;k&#299;rtana movement under the banner of Krishna consciousness and protest against the sinful activities of all the world's governments.</P><P>The Krishna consciousness movement is not a sentimental religious movement; it is a movement for the reformation of all the anomalies of human society. If people take to it seriously, discharging this duty scientifically, as ordered by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, the world will see peace and prosperity instead of being confused and hopeless under useless governments. There are always rogues and thieves in human society, and as soon as a weak government is unable to execute its duties, these rogues and thieves come out to do their business. Thus the entire society becomes a hell unfit for gentlemen to live in. There is an immediate need for a good government &#8212; a government by the people, with Krishna consciousness. Unless the masses of people become Krishna conscious, they cannot be good men. The Krishna consciousness movement that &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu started by chanting the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra still has its potency. Therefore people should understand it seriously and scientifically and spread it all over the world.</P><P>The sa&#324;k&#299;rtana movement started by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is described in the Caitanya-bh&#257;gavata, Madhya-khanda, Twenty-third Chapter, beginning with verse 241, which states, "My dear Lord, let my mind be fixed at Your lotus feet." Following Lord Caitanya's chanting, all the devotees reproduced the same sound He chanted. In this way the Lord proceeded, leading the entire party on the strand roads by the bank of the Ganges. When the Lord came to His own gh&#257;ta, or bathing place, He danced more and more. Then He proceeded to M&#257;dh&#257;i's gh&#257;ta. In this way &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, the Supreme Lord, who was known as Vi&#347;vambhara, danced all over the banks of the Ganges. Then He proceeded to B&#257;rakon&#257;-gh&#257;ta, then N&#257;gariy&#257;-gh&#257;ta, and, traveling through Ga&#324;g&#257;nagara, reached Simuliy&#257;, a quarter at one end of the town. All these places surround &#346;r&#299; M&#257;y&#257;pur. After reaching Simuliy&#257;, the Lord proceeded toward the Kazi's house, and in this way He reached the door of Chand Kazi.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="140.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="142.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
