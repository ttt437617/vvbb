May I know by whose strength you are doing so?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>It appears that from the aggression of Baktiy&#257;r Khiliji in Bengal until the time of Chand Kazi, Hindus, or the followers of the Vedic principles, were greatly suppressed. Like the Hindus in present-day Pakistan, practically no one could execute the Hindu religious principles freely. Chand Kazi referred to this condition of Hindu society. Formerly the Hindus had not been straightforward in executing their Hindu principles, but now they were freely chanting the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra. Therefore it must have been by the strength of someone else that they were so daring.</P><P>Actually, that was the fact. Although the members of the so-called Hindu society had followed the social customs and formulas, they had practically forgotten to execute their religious principles strictly. But with the presence of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu they actually began following the regulative principles according to His order. That order is still existing, and anywhere and everywhere, in all parts of the world, one can execute it. That order is to become a spiritual master under the direction of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu by following the regulative principles, chanting daily at least sixteen rounds of the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra, and preaching the cult of Krishna consciousness all over the world. If we adhere to the order of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, we shall get spiritual strength without a doubt, and we shall be free to preach this cult of the Hare Krishna movement and not be hampered by anyone.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="125.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="127.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
