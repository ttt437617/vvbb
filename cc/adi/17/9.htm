He again displayed such symptoms after returning home.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>When &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu went to Gay&#257;, accompanied by many of His disciples, He became sick on the way. He had such a high fever that He asked His students to bring water that had washed the feet of br&#257;hmanas, and when they brought it the Lord drank it and was cured. Therefore everyone should respect the position of a br&#257;hmana, as indicated by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. Neither the Lord nor His followers displayed any disrespect to br&#257;hmanas.</P><P>The followers of the Lord must be prepared to offer br&#257;hmanas all due respect. But preachers of Lord Caitanya's cult object if someone presents himself as a br&#257;hmana without having the necessary qualifications. The followers of Lord Caitanya cannot blindly accept that everyone born in a br&#257;hmana family is a br&#257;hmana. Therefore one should not indiscriminately follow the Lord's example of showing respect to br&#257;hmanas by drinking water that has washed their feet. Gradually the br&#257;hmana families have become degraded because of the contamination of Kali-yuga. Thus they misguide people by exploiting their sentiments.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
