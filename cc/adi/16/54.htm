I shall state them one after another. Kindly hear Me and then give your judgment.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In the verse beginning with mahattvam ga&#324;g&#257;y&#257;h there are five literary ornaments and five examples of faulty composition. There are two examples of the fault called avimrishta-vidhey&#257;m&#347;a and one example each of the faults viruddha-mati, punar-ukti and bhagna-krama.</P><P>Vimrishta means "clean," and vidhey&#257;m&#347;a means "predicate." It is a general rule of composition to establish a subject first and then give its predicate. For example, according to Sanskrit grammar if one says, "This man is learned," his composition is in order. But if one says, "Learned is this man," the composition is not in order. Such a flaw is called avimrishta-vidhey&#257;m&#347;a-dosha, or the fault of unclean composition. The subject matter to be known of the verse is the glorification of the Ganges, and therefore the word idam ("this"), or what is known, should have been placed before instead of after the glorification. The subject matter already known should be placed before the unknown so that its meaning will not be misconstrued.</P><P>The second instance of avimrishta-vidhey&#257;m&#347;a-dosha occurs in the words dvit&#299;ya-&#347;r&#299;-lakshm&#299;r iva. In this composition the word dvit&#299;ya ("second") is vidheya, or unknown. Placing the unknown first to make the compound word dvit&#299;ya-&#347;r&#299;-lakshm&#299;r is another fault. The words dvit&#299;ya-&#347;r&#299;-lakshm&#299;r iva were intended to compare the Ganges to the goddess of fortune, but because of this fault the meaning of the compound word was bewildering.</P><P>The third fault is that of viruddha-mati, or contradictory conception, in the words bhav&#257;n&#299;-bhartuh. The word bhav&#257;n&#299; refers to the wife of Bhava, Lord &#346;iva. But since Bhav&#257;n&#299; is already known as the wife of Lord &#346;iva, to add the word bhart&#257;, "husband," thus forming a compound meaning "the husband of the wife of Lord &#346;iva," is contradictory, for thus it appears as if the wife of Lord &#346;iva had another husband.</P><P>The fourth fault is punar-ukti, or redundancy, which occurs when the verb vibhavati ("flourishes"), which should have ended the composition, is further qualified by the unnecessary adjective adbhuta-gun&#257; ("endowed with wonderful qualities"). The fifth fault is bhagna-krama, which means "broken order." In the first, third and fourth lines there is anupr&#257;sa, or alliteration, created by the sounds ta, ra and bha, but in the second line there is no such anupr&#257;sa, and therefore the order is broken.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="53.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
