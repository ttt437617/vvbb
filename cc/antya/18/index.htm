Greatly afflicted by separation from Krishna, He ran and dove into the sea and remained unconscious in the water the entire night. In the morning, He was found by His personal devotees.

Sometimes He became completely unconscious.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.8</B></A>: When He heard Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara recite a verse concerning the r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257; or He Himself recited one, He would personally explain it, as He had previously done.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.9</B></A>: In this way, He explained the meaning of all the verses concerning the r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;. Sometimes He would be very sad and sometimes very happy.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.10</B></A>: To explain fully all those verses and all the transformations that took place in the Lord's body would require a very large volume.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.11</B></A>: So as not to increase the size of this book, I have not written about all the Lord's pastimes, for He performed them every moment of every day for twelve years.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.12</B></A>: As I have previously indicated, I am describing the mad speeches and bodily transformations of the Lord only in brief.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.13</B></A>: If Ananta, with His one thousand hoods, tried to describe even one day's pastimes of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, He would find them impossible to describe fully.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.14</B></A>: If Gane&#347;a, Lord &#346;iva's son and the expert scribe of the demigods, tried for millions of millenniums to fully describe one day of the Lord's pastimes, he would be unable to find their limit.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.15</B></A>: Even Lord Krishna is struck with wonder at seeing the transformations of ecstasy in His devotees. If Krishna Himself cannot estimate the limits of such emotions, how could others?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16-17.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.16-17</B></A>: Krishna Himself cannot fully understand the conditions, the mode of progress, the happiness and unhappiness, and the moods of ecstatic love of His devotees. He therefore accepts the role of a devotee to taste these emotions fully.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.18</B></A>: Ecstatic love of Krishna makes Krishna and His devotees dance, and it also dances personally. In this way, all three dance together in one place.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.19</B></A>: One who wants to describe the transformations of ecstatic love of Krishna is like a dwarf trying to catch the moon in the sky.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.20</B></A>: As the wind can carry away but a drop of the water in the ocean, a living entity can touch only a particle of the ocean of love of Krishna.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.21</B></A>: Endless waves arise moment after moment in that ocean of love. How could an insignificant living entity estimate their limits?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.22</B></A>: Only a person on the level of Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara Gosv&#257;m&#299; can fully know what Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu tastes in His love for Krishna.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.23</B></A>: When an ordinary living entity describes the pastimes of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, he purifies himself by touching one drop of that great ocean.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.24</B></A>: Thus all the verses about the r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257; dance were recited. Then finally the verse concerning the pastimes in the water was recited.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.25</B></A>: "As an independent leader among elephants enters the water with its female elephants, Krishna, who is transcendental to the Vedic principles of morality, entered the water of the Yamun&#257; with the gop&#299;s. His chest had brushed against their breasts, crushing His flower garland and coloring it with red ku&#324;kuma powder. Attracted by the fragrance of that garland, humming bumblebees followed Krishna like celestial beings of Gandharvaloka. In this way, Lord Krishna mitigated the fatigue of the r&#257;sa dance."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.26</B></A>: While thus wandering near the temple of &#256;itot&#257;, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu suddenly saw the sea.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.27</B></A>: Brightened by the shining light of the moon, the high waves of the sea glittered like the waters of the river Yamun&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.28</B></A>: Mistaking the sea for the Yamun&#257;, the Lord ran swiftly and jumped into the water, unseen by the others.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.29</B></A>: Falling into the sea, He lost consciousness and could not understand where He was. Sometimes He sank beneath the waves, and sometimes He floated above them.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.30</B></A>: The waves carried Him here and there like a piece of dry wood. Who can understand this dramatic performance by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.31</B></A>: Keeping the Lord sometimes submerged and sometimes afloat, the waves carried Him toward the Kon&#257;rka temple.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.32</B></A>: &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu fully merged in the pastimes Lord Krishna performed with the gop&#299;s in the waters of the Yamun&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.33</B></A>: Meanwhile, all the devotees, headed by Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara, lost sight of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. Astonished, they began searching for Him, asking, "Where has the Lord gone?"</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.34</B></A>: &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu had run off at the speed of the mind. No one could see Him. Thus everyone was puzzled as to His whereabouts.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.35</B></A>: "Has the Lord gone to the temple of Jagann&#257;tha, or has He fallen down in madness in some garden?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.36</B></A>: "Perhaps He went to the Gundic&#257; temple, or to Lake Narendra, or to the Cataka-parvata. Maybe He went to the temple at Kon&#257;rka."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="37.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.37</B></A>: Talking like this, the devotees wandered here and there looking for the Lord. Finally they came to the shore, accompanied by many others.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.38</B></A>: While they were searching for the Lord, the night ended, and thus they all decided, "Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has now disappeared."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.39</B></A>: In separation from the Lord, everyone felt as though he had lost his very life. The devotees concluded that there must have been some mishap. They could not think of anything else.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.40</B></A>: "A relative or intimate friend is always fearful of some injury to his beloved."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.41</B></A>: When they arrived at the seashore, they conferred among themselves. Then some of them sought out &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu at Cataka-parvata.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.42</B></A>: Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara proceeded east with others, looking for the Lord on the beach or in the water.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="43.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.43</B></A>: Everyone was overwhelmed with moroseness and almost unconscious, but out of ecstatic love they continued to wander here and there, searching for the Lord.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.44</B></A>: Passing along the beach, they saw a fisherman approaching with his net over his shoulder. Laughing, crying, dancing and singing, he kept repeating the holy name "Hari, Hari."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.45</B></A>: Seeing the activities of the fisherman, everyone was astonished. Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara Gosv&#257;m&#299;, therefore, asked him for information.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.46</B></A>: "My dear fisherman," he said, "why are you behaving like this? Have you seen someone hereabouts? What is the cause of your behavior? Please tell us."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.47</B></A>: The fisherman replied, "I have not seen a single person here, but while casting my net in the water, I captured a dead body.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="48.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.48</B></A>: "I lifted it with great care, thinking it a big fish, but as soon as I saw that it was a corpse, great fear arose in my mind.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.49</B></A>: "As I tried to release the net, I touched the body, and as soon as I touched it, a ghost entered my heart.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="50.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.50</B></A>: "I shivered in fear and shed tears. My voice faltered, and all the hairs on my body stood up.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.51</B></A>: "I do not know whether the corpse I found was the ghost of a dead br&#257;hmana or an ordinary man, but as soon as one looks upon it, the ghost enters his body.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.52</B></A>: "The body of this ghost is very long, five to seven cubits. Each of its arms and legs is as much as three cubits long.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="53.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.53</B></A>: "Its joints are all separated beneath the skin, which is completely slack. No one could see it and remain alive in his body.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="54.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.54</B></A>: "That ghost has taken the form of a corpse, but He keeps his eyes open. Sometimes He utters the sounds 'go&#324;-go&#324;,' and sometimes He remains unconscious.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.55</B></A>: "I have seen that ghost directly, and He is haunting me. But if I die, who will take care of my wife and children?</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="56.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.56</B></A>: "The ghost is certainly very difficult to talk about, but I am going to find an exorcist and ask him if he can release me from it.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="57.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.57</B></A>: "I wander alone at night killing fish in solitary places, but because I remember the hymn to Lord Nrisimha, ghosts do not touch me.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="58.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.58</B></A>: "This ghost, however, overcomes me with redoubled strength when I chant the Nrisimha mantra. When I even see the form of this ghost, great fear arises in my mind.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="59.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.59</B></A>: "Do not go near there. I forbid you. If you go, that ghost will catch you all."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="60.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.60</B></A>: Hearing this, Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara could understand the full truth of the matter. He spoke sweetly to the fisherman.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="61.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.61</B></A>: "I am a famous exorcist," he said, "and I know how to rid you of this ghost." He then chanted some mantras and placed his hand on top of the fisherman's head.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="62.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.62</B></A>: He slapped the fisherman three times and said, "Now the ghost has gone away. Do not be afraid." By saying this, he pacified the fisherman.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="63.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.63</B></A>: The fisherman was affected by ecstatic love, but he was also fearful. He had thus become doubly agitated. Now that his fear had subsided, however, he had become somewhat normal.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="64.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.64</B></A>: Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara said to the fisherman, "My dear sir, the person you are thinking is a ghost is not actually a ghost but is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; Krishna Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="65.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.65</B></A>: "Because of ecstatic love, the Lord fell into the sea, and you have caught Him in your net and rescued Him.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="66.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.66</B></A>: "Simply touching Him has awakened your dormant love of Krishna, but because you thought Him a ghost, you were very much afraid of Him.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="67.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.67</B></A>: "Now that your fear has gone and your mind is peaceful, please show me where He is."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="68.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.68</B></A>: The fisherman replied, "I have seen the Lord many times, but this is not He. This body is very much deformed."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="69.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.69</B></A>: Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara said, "The Lord's body becomes transformed in His love for God. Sometimes the joints of His bones separate, and His body becomes very much elongated."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="70.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.70</B></A>: Hearing this, the fisherman became very happy. He brought all the devotees with him and showed them &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="71.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.71</B></A>: The Lord was lying on the ground, His body elongated and bleached white by the water. He was covered from head to foot with sand.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="72.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.72</B></A>: The Lord's body was stretched, and His skin was slack and hanging loose. To lift Him and take Him the long distance home would have been impossible.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="73.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.73</B></A>: The devotees removed His wet undergarment and replaced it with a dry one. Then, laying the Lord on an outer cloth, they cleaned the sand from His body.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="74.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.74</B></A>: They all performed sa&#324;k&#299;rtana, loudly chanting the holy name of Krishna into the Lord's ear.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="75.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.75</B></A>: After some time the sound of the holy name entered the ear of the Lord, who immediately got up, making a great noise.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="76.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.76</B></A>: As soon as He got up, His bones assumed their proper places. With half-external consciousness, the Lord looked here and there.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="77.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.77</B></A>: The Lord remained in one of three different states of consciousness at all times: internal, external and half-external.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="78.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.78</B></A>: When the Lord was deeply absorbed in internal consciousness but He nevertheless exhibited some external consciousness, devotees called His condition ardha-b&#257;hya, or half-external consciousness.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="79.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.79</B></A>: In this half-external consciousness, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu talked like a madman.

This is a reversal of their natural behavior, but in Lord Krishna's kingdom such reversals are a principle of His pastimes.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="98.htm"><B>CC Antya 18.98</B></A>: "The blue lotuses are friends of the sun-god, and though they all live together, the blue lotuses plunder the cakrav&#257;kas. The red lotuses, however, blossom at night and are therefore strangers or enemies to the cakrav&#257;kas. Yet in Krishna's pastimes the red lotuses, which are the hands of the gop&#299;s, protect their cakrav&#257;ka breasts.
