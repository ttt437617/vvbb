You reveal the beautiful face of Krishna and make the mind and eyes greedy, but after they have drunk that nectar for only a moment, you whisk Krishna away to another place.

There is no intimate relationship between you and Me. Krishna, however, is My life and soul. It is We who live together, and it is He who has become so cruel.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="51.htm"><B>CC Antya 19.51</B></A>: "He for whom I have left everything is personally killing Me with His own hands. Krishna has no fear of killing women. Indeed, I am dying for Him, but He doesn't even turn back to look at Me. Within a moment, He has broken off Our loving affairs.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm"><B>CC Antya 19.52</B></A>: "Yet why should I be angry with Krishna? It is the fault of My own misfortune.
