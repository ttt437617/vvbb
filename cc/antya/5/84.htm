Generally this qualification is attributed to br&#257;hmanas and sanny&#257;s&#299;s. Sanny&#257;sa, the renounced order of life, is the topmost position for a br&#257;hmana, a member of the highest of the four varnas (br&#257;hmana, kshatriya, vai&#347;ya and &#347;&#363;dra). According to public opinion, a person born in a br&#257;hmana family, duly reformed by the purificatory processes and properly initiated by a spiritual master, is an authority on Vedic literature. When such a person is offered the sanny&#257;sa order, he comes to occupy the topmost position. The br&#257;hmana is supposed to be the spiritual master of the other three varnas, namely kshatriya, vai&#347;ya and &#347;&#363;dra, and the sanny&#257;s&#299; is supposed to be the spiritual master even of the exalted br&#257;hmanas.</P><P>Generally br&#257;hmanas and sanny&#257;s&#299;s are very proud of their spiritual positions. Therefore, to cut down their false pride, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu preached Krishna consciousness through R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya, who was neither a member of the renounced order nor a born br&#257;hmana. Indeed, &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya was a grihastha belonging to the &#347;&#363;dra class, yet &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu arranged for him to be the master who taught Pradyumna Mi&#347;ra, a highly qualified br&#257;hmana born in a br&#257;hmana family. Even &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu Himself, although belonging to the renounced order, took instruction from &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya. In this way &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu exhibited His opulence through &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya. That is the special significance of this incident.</P><P>According to &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu's philosophy, yei krishna-tattva-vett&#257;, sei 'guru' haya: [Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/8/128.htm">Madhya 8.128</A>] anyone who knows the science of Krishna can become a spiritual master, without reference to whether or not he is a br&#257;hmana or sanny&#257;s&#299;. Ordinary people cannot understand the essence of &#347;&#257;stra, nor can they understand the pure character, behavior and abilities of strict followers of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu's principles. The Krishna consciousness movement is creating pure, exalted Vaishnavas even from those born in families considered lower than those of &#347;&#363;dras. This is proof that a Vaishnava may appear in any family, as confirmed in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/2/4/18.htm">2.4.18</A>):</P><P>kir&#257;ta-h&#363;n&#257;ndhra-pulinda-pulka&#347;&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>&#257;bh&#299;ra-&#347;umbh&#257; yavan&#257;h khas&#257;dayah</P><P CLASS=n>ye 'nye ca p&#257;p&#257; yad-ap&#257;&#347;ray&#257;&#347;ray&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;udhyanti tasmai prabhavishnave namah</P><P>"Kir&#257;tas, H&#363;nas, &#256;ndhras, Pulindas, Pulka&#347;as, &#256;bh&#299;ras, &#346;umbhas, Yavanas and members of the Khasa races, and even others addicted to sinful acts, can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, due to His being the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/2/4/18.htm">2.4.18</A>) By the grace of the Supreme Lord Vishnu, anyone can be completely purified, become a preacher of Krishna consciousness, and become the spiritual master of the entire world. This principle is accepted in all Vedic literature. Evidence can be quoted from authoritative &#347;&#257;stras showing how a lowborn person can become the spiritual master of the entire world. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is to be considered the most munificent personality, for He distributes the real essence of the Vedic &#347;&#257;stras to anyone who becomes qualified by becoming His sincere servant.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="83.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="85.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
