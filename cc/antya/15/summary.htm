After seeing the upala-bhoga ceremony of Lord Jagann&#257;tha, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu once more began to feel ecstatic emotions. When He saw the garden on the beach by the sea, He again thought that He was in Vrind&#257;vana, and when He began to think of Krishna engaging in His different pastimes, transcendental emotions excited Him again. On the night of the r&#257;sa dance, the gop&#299;s, bereaved by Krishna's absence, searched for Krishna from one forest to another. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu adopted the same transcendental thoughts as those of the gop&#299;s and was filled with ecstatic emotion. Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara Gosv&#257;m&#299; recited a verse from the G&#299;ta-govinda just suitable to the Lord's emotions. Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu then exhibited the ecstatic transformations known as bh&#257;vodaya, bh&#257;va-sandhi, bh&#257;va-&#347;&#257;balya and so on. The Lord experienced all eight kinds of ecstatic transformations, and He relished them very much.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../14/123.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
