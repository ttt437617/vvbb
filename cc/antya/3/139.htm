Vritti means "profession." The griha-vritti of the prostitute was to enchant foolish people and induce them to indulge in sex. Here, however, griha-vritti is not a suitable word. The proper word is griha-vitta, which means "all the possessions she had in her home." All the girl's possessions had been earned by professional prostitution and were therefore products of her sinful life. When such possessions are given to br&#257;hmanas and Vaishnavas who can engage them in the service of the Lord because of their advancement in spiritual life, this indirectly helps the person who gives the charity, for he is thus relieved of sinful reactions. As Krishna promises, aham tv&#257;m sarva-p&#257;pebhyo mokshayishy&#257;mi: "I shall save you from all sinful reactions." When our Krishna conscious devotees go out to beg charity or collect contributions in the form of membership fees, the money thus coming to the Krishna consciousness movement is strictly employed to advance Krishna consciousness all over the world. The Krishna conscious devotees collect the money of others for the service of Krishna, and they are satisfied with Krishna's pras&#257;dam and whatever He gives them for their maintenance. They do not desire material comforts. However, they go to great pains to engage the possessions of prostitutes, or persons who are more or less like prostitutes, in the service of the Lord and thus free them from sinful reactions. A Vaishnava guru accepts money or other contributions, but he does not employ such contributions for sense gratification. A pure Vaishnava thinks himself unfit to help free even one person from the reactions of sinful life, but he engages one's hard-earned money in the service of the Lord and thus frees one from sinful reactions. A Vaishnava guru is never dependent on the contributions of his disciples. Following the instructions of Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura, a pure Vaishnava does not personally take even a single paisa from anyone, but he induces his followers to spend for the service of the Lord whatever possessions they have.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="138.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="140.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
