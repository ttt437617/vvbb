The inside part was especially meant for the family, and the ladies would live there unexposed to men. That part was called the bhitara-b&#257;di, or inside house. In the outside house, or bahir-b&#257;di, the respectable gentleman received visitors and kept his business office. The Durg&#257;-mandapa would be part of the outside house. Thus when Lord Nity&#257;nanda entered the outside house, R&#257;macandra Kh&#257;n was in the inside house with the members of his family. When Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu arrived, R&#257;macandra Kh&#257;n did not receive Him personally but sent his servant to inform Him indirectly to go away.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="150.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="152.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
