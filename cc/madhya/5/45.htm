By argument, I shall defeat the young br&#257;hmana."</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The son of the elderly br&#257;hmana was an atheist and a follower of the Raghun&#257;tha-smriti. He was very expert in dealing with pounds-shillings-pence, but he was fool number one. Consequently, he did not believe in the spiritual position of the Deity, nor did he have any faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, as a typical idol worshiper, he considered the form of the Lord to be made of stone or wood. Thus he assured his father that the witness was only a stone Deity and was not capable of speaking. Besides that, he assured his father that the Deity was situated far away and consequently could not come to bear witness. In essence, he was saying, "Have no anxiety. You do not have to lie directly, but you should speak like a diplomat, like King Yudhishthira when he spoke to Dron&#257;c&#257;rya &#8212; a&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257; hata iti gajah. Following this principle, simply say that you do not remember anything and are completely unaware of the statements given by the young br&#257;hmana. If you make the background like that, I shall know how to fill in the argument and defeat him by word jugglery. Thus I shall save you from having to give your daughter to him. In this way, our aristocracy will be saved. You have nothing to worry about."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="46.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
