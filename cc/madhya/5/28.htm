Therefore Bh&#299;shmaka withdrew his decision and decided to offer Rukmin&#299; to the King of Cedi, &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la, who was a cousin of Krishna's. However, Rukmin&#299; conceived of a trick: she sent a letter to Krishna asking Him to kidnap her. Thus in order to please Rukmin&#299;, who was His great devotee, Krishna kidnapped her. There ensued a great fight between Krishna and the opposing party, headed by Rukmin&#299;'s brother Rukm&#299;. Rukm&#299; was defeated and, because of his harsh words against Krishna, was about to be killed, but he was saved at the request of Rukmin&#299;. However, Krishna shaved off all of Rukm&#299;'s hair with His sword. &#346;r&#299; Balar&#257;ma did not like this, and so to please Rukmin&#299;, Balar&#257;ma rebuked Krishna.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
