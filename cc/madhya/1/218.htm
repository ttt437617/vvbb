Hari!"</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura says, ch&#257;diy&#257; vaishnava sev&#257; nist&#257;ra peyeche keb&#257;: unless one serves a Vaishnava, he cannot be delivered. The spiritual master initiates the disciple to deliver him, and if the disciple executes the order of the spiritual master and does not offend other Vaishnavas, his path is clear. Consequently &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu requested all the Vaishnavas present to show mercy toward the two brothers, R&#363;pa and San&#257;tana, who had just been initiated by the Lord. When a Vaishnava sees that another Vaishnava is a recipient of the Lord's mercy, he becomes very happy. Vaishnavas are not envious. If a Vaishnava, by the mercy of the Lord, is empowered by Him to distribute the Lord's holy name all over the world, other Vaishnavas become very joyful &#8212; that is, if they are truly Vaishnavas. One who is envious of the success of a Vaishnava is certainly not a Vaishnava himself but is an ordinary, mundane man. Envy and jealousy are manifested by mundane people, not by Vaishnavas. Why should a Vaishnava be envious of another Vaishnava who is successful in spreading the holy name of the Lord? An actual Vaishnava is very pleased to accept another Vaishnava who is bestowing the Lord's mercy. A mundane person in the dress of a Vaishnava should not be respected but rejected. This is enjoined in the &#347;&#257;stra (upeksh&#257;). The word upeksh&#257; means neglect. One should neglect an envious person. A preacher's duty is to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, make friendships with Vaishnavas, show mercy to the innocent and reject or neglect those who are envious or jealous. There are many jealous people in the dress of Vaishnavas in this Krishna consciousness movement, and they should be completely neglected. There is no need to serve a jealous person who is in the dress of a Vaishnava. When Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura says ch&#257;diy&#257; vaishnava sev&#257; nist&#257;ra peyeche keb&#257;, he is indicating an actual Vaishnava, not an envious or jealous person in the dress of a Vaishnava.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="217.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="219.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
