Yet He mentioned these faults one after another as if He were offended by their intense affection. The personal associates of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu sometimes behaved contrary to regulative principles out of intense love for the Lord, and because of their love &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu Himself sometimes violated the regulative principles of a sanny&#257;s&#299;. In the eyes of the public, such violations are not good, but &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was so controlled by His devotees' love that He was obliged to break some of the rules. Although accusing them, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was indirectly indicating that He was very satisfied with their behavior in pure love of Godhead. Therefore in verse 27 He mentions that His devotees and associates place more importance on love of Krishna than on social etiquette. There are many instances of devotional service rendered by previous &#257;c&#257;ryas who did not care about social behavior when intensely absorbed in love for Krishna. Unfortunately, as long as we are within this material world, we must observe social customs to avoid criticism by the general populace. This is &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu's desire.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
