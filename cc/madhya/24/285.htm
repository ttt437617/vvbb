One of them is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Krishna, and the others are different incarnations or expansions of Krishna.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The word &#257;tm&#257; also includes all kinds of personalities known as Bhagav&#257;n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means that Krishna has unlimited expansions. This is described in the Brahma-samhit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/46.htm">5.46</A>):</P><P>d&#299;p&#257;rcir eva hi da&#347;&#257;ntaram abhyupetya</P><P CLASS=n>d&#299;p&#257;yate vivrita-hetu-sam&#257;na-dharm&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>yas t&#257;drig eva hi ca vishnutay&#257; vibh&#257;ti</P><P CLASS=n>govindam &#257;di-purusham tam aham bhaj&#257;mi</P><P>The expansions of Krishna are thus compared to candles that have been lit from an original candle. All the secondary candles are equally powerful, but the original candle is that from which all the others have been lit. Krishna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is expanded as Balar&#257;ma, Sa&#324;karshana, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and V&#257;sudeva. In this way there are innumerable incarnations and expansions who are also called Bhagav&#257;n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P>Regarding the variety of personalities known as Bhagav&#257;n, &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Th&#257;kura says that the Personality of Godhead known as Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that His expansions are also called the Personality of Godhead. In other words, Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the origin of all other Personalities of Godhead. Speculative philosophers and mystic yog&#299;s also meditate upon the form of Krishna, but this form is not the form of the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a Bhagav&#257;n is but a partial representation of the Lord's full potency. Nonetheless, He also has to be understood to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To clarify this matter, one should simply understand that Krishna, the son of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja in Vrind&#257;vana, the friend of the cowherd boys and lover of the gop&#299;s, is actually the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is attained by spontaneous love. Although His expansions are also called the Supreme Personality of Godhead, They are attained only by the execution of regulative devotional service.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="284.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="286.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
