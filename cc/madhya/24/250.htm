That is a slight offense on your part. But when you consciously give them unnecessary pain by leaving them half-dead, you incur very great sins.'</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>This is another good instruction to animal-killers. There are always animal-killers and animal-eaters in human society because less civilized people are accustomed to eating meat. In the Vedic civilization, meat-eaters are advised to kill an animal for the goddess K&#257;l&#299; or a similar demigod. This is in order not to give the animal unnecessary pain, as slaughterhouses do. In the bali-d&#257;na sacrifice to a demigod, it is recommended to cut the throat of an animal with one slice. This should be done on a dark-moon night, and the painful noises expressed by the animal at the time of being slaughtered are not to be heard by anyone. There are also many other restrictions. Slaughter is allowed only once a month, and the killer of the animal has to suffer similar pains in his next life. At the present moment, so-called civilized men do not sacrifice animals to a deity in a religious or ritualistic way. They openly kill animals daily by the thousands for no purpose other than the satisfaction of the tongue. Because of this the entire world is suffering in so many ways. Politicians are unnecessarily declaring war, and according to the stringent laws of material nature, massacres are taking place between nations.</P><P>prakriteh kriyam&#257;n&#257;ni gunaih karm&#257;ni sarva&#347;ah</P><P CLASS=n>aha&#324;k&#257;ra-vim&#363;dh&#257;tm&#257; kart&#257;ham iti manyate</P><P>"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/3/27.htm">Bg. 3.27</A>) The laws of prakriti (nature) are very stringent. No one should think that he has the freedom to kill animals and not suffer the consequences. One cannot be safe by doing this. N&#257;rada Muni herein says that animal-killing is offensive, especially when animals are given unnecessary pain. Meat-eaters and animal-killers are advised not to purchase meat from the slaughterhouse. They can worship K&#257;l&#299; once a month, kill some unimportant animal and eat it. Even by following this method, one is still an offender.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="249.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="251.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
