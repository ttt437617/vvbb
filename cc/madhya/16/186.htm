According to this verse, it does not matter what position a person holds. One may be the lowest of the low &#8212; a cand&#257;la, or dog-eater &#8212; but if he takes to chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord, he is immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. This is especially true in this Age of Kali.</P><P>harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;ma harer n&#257;maiva kevalam</P><P CLASS=n>kalau n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva n&#257;sty eva gatir anyath&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>[<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/adi/17/21.htm">Adi 17.21</A>]</P><P>(Brihan-n&#257;rad&#299;ya Pur&#257;na <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/purana38/126">38.126</A>)</P><P>"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, the only means of deliverance is the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way." A person born in a br&#257;hmana family cannot perform Vedic sacrifices until he is properly purified and has attained his sacred thread. However, according to the present verse of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita (quoted from &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam), it is understood that even a lowborn person can immediately perform sacrifices if he sincerely chants and hears the holy name of the Lord. Sometimes envious people ask how Europeans and Americans in this Krishna consciousness movement can become br&#257;hmanas and perform sacrifices. They do not know that the Europeans and Americans have already been purified by chanting the holy name of the Lord &#8212; Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare. This is the proof. &#346;v&#257;do 'pi sadyah savan&#257;ya kalpate. One may be born in a family of dog-eaters, but he can perform sacrifices simply by chanting the mah&#257;-mantra.</P><P>Those who find fault in the Western Vaishnavas should consider this statement from &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam and the commentary on this verse by &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; has stated that to become a br&#257;hmana one has to wait for purification and undergo the sacred thread ceremony, but a chanter of the holy name does not have to wait for the sacred thread ceremony. We do not allow devotees to perform sacrifices until they are properly initiated in the sacred thread ceremony. Yet according to this verse, an offenseless chanter of the holy name is already fit to perform a fire ceremony, even though he is not doubly initiated by the sacred thread ceremony. This is the verdict given by Devah&#363;ti, the mother of Lord Kapiladeva, when He was instructing her in pure S&#257;&#324;khya philosophy.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="185.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="187.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
