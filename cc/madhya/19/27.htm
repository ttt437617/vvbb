He ordered the arrest of San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; so that he would not be able to leave.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>It is said that the relationship between the Nawab of Bengal and San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; was very intimate. The Nawab used to consider San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; his younger brother, and when San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; showed a very strong intention to resign, the Nawab, feeling familial affection, essentially said, "I am your elder brother, but I do not look after the state management. My only business is attacking other states with my soldiers and fighting everywhere as a plunderer. Because I am a meat-eater [yavana], I am used to hunting all kinds of living beings. In this way I am destroying all kinds of living entities in Bengal. While engaged in this destructive business, I am hoping that you will tend to the administration of the state. Since I, your elder brother, am engaged in such a destructive business, you, being my younger brother, should look after the state management. If you do not, how will things continue?" This talk was based on a family relationship, and San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; also replied in an intimate and joking way. Essentially he told the Nawab, "My dear brother, you are the independent ruler of Bengal. You can act in whatever way you like, and if someone commits a fault, you can punish him accordingly." In other words, San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; was saying that since the Nawab was accustomed to acting like a plunderer, he should go ahead and take action. Since San&#257;tana was not showing much enthusiasm for performing his duty, the Nawab should dismiss him from his service. The Nawab could understand the intention of San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;'s statement. He therefore left in an angry mood and ordered San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;'s arrest.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
