You are a follower of Vedic principles and are a well experienced performer of many sacrifices. You also belong to the aristocracy."</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Generally br&#257;hmanas are puffed up with false prestige because they belong to the aristocracy and perform many Vedic sacrifices. In South India especially, this fastidious position is most prominent. At any rate, this was the case five hundred years ago. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu actually started a revolution against this brahminical system by inaugurating the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra. By this chanting, one can be delivered regardless of caste, creed, color or social position. Whoever chants the Hare Krishna mah&#257;-mantra is immediately purified due to the transcendental position of devotional service. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is here hinting to Vallabha Bhatt&#257;c&#257;rya that an exalted br&#257;hmana who makes sacrifices and follows Vedic principles should not neglect a person who is engaged in devotional service by chanting the holy name of the Lord.</P><P>Actually R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; did not belong to a lower caste. He was from a highly aristocratic br&#257;hmana family, but due to his association with the Muslim Nawab, he was considered fallen and was excommunicated from br&#257;hmana society. However, due to his advanced devotional service, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu accepted him as a gosv&#257;m&#299;. Vallabha Bhatt&#257;c&#257;rya knew all this. One who is a devotee is above caste and creed, yet Vallabha Bhatt&#257;c&#257;rya felt himself prestigious.</P><P>The present head of the Vallabha Bhatt&#257;c&#257;rya samprad&#257;ya of Bombay is named D&#299;kshita Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. He is very friendly to our movement, and whenever we meet him, this learned br&#257;hmana scholar highly praises the activities of the Hare Krishna movement. He is a life member of our Society, and although he is a learned scholar in the brahminical caste tradition, he accepts our Society and considers its members bona fide devotees of Lord Vishnu.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="68.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="70.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
