If he waters the seed gradually by the process of &#347;ravana and k&#299;rtana [hearing and chanting], the seed will begin to sprout.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>To live with devotees or to live in a temple means to associate with the &#347;ravana-k&#299;rtana process. Sometimes neophyte devotees think that they can continue the &#347;ravana-k&#299;rtana process without worshiping the Deity, but the execution of such &#347;ravana-k&#299;rtana is meant for highly developed devotees like Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura, who engaged in the &#347;ravana-k&#299;rtana process without worshiping the Deity. However, one should not falsely imitate Harid&#257;sa Th&#257;kura and abandon Deity worship just to try to engage in &#347;ravana-k&#299;rtana. This is not possible for neophyte devotees.</P><P>The word guru-pras&#257;da indicates that the spiritual master is very merciful in bestowing the boon of devotional service upon the disciple. That is the best possible gift the spiritual master has to offer. Those with a background of pious life are eligible to receive life's supreme benefit, and to bestow this benefit, the Supreme Personality of Godhead sends His representative to impart His mercy. Endowed with the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual master distributes the mercy to those who are elevated and pious. Thus the spiritual master trains his disciples to render devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called guru-krip&#257;. It is krishna-pras&#257;da, Krishna's mercy, that He sends a bona fide spiritual master to the deserving disciple. By the mercy of Krishna, one meets the bona fide spiritual master, and by the mercy of the spiritual master, the disciple is fully trained in the devotional service of the Lord.</P><P>Bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja means "the seed of devotional service." Everything has an original cause, or seed. For any idea, program, plan or device, there is first of all the contemplation of the plan, and that is called the b&#299;ja, or seed. The methods, rules and regulations by which one is perfectly trained in devotional service constitute the bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja, or seed of devotional service. This bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja is received from the spiritual master by the grace of Krishna. Other seeds, called any&#257;bhil&#257;sha-b&#299;ja, include karma-b&#299;ja and jñ&#257;na-b&#299;ja. If one is not fortunate enough to receive the bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja from the spiritual master, he instead cultivates such seeds as karma-b&#299;ja, jñ&#257;na-b&#299;ja, or political, social or philanthropic b&#299;jas. However, the bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja is different from these other b&#299;jas. The bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja can be received only through the mercy of the spiritual master. Therefore one has to satisfy the spiritual master to get the bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja (yasya pras&#257;d&#257;d bhagavat-pras&#257;dah **). The bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja is the origin of devotional service. Unless one satisfies the spiritual master, he gets the b&#299;ja, or root cause, of karma, jñ&#257;na and yoga without the benefit of devotional service. But one who is faithful to his spiritual master gets the bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja. This bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja is received when one is initiated by the bona fide spiritual master. After receiving the spiritual master's mercy, one must repeat his instructions, and this is called &#347;ravana-k&#299;rtana &#8212; hearing and chanting. One who has not properly heard from the spiritual master or who does not follow the regulative principles is not fit for chanting (k&#299;rtana). This is explained in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/2/41.htm">2.41</A>): vyavas&#257;y&#257;tmik&#257; buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana. One who has not listened carefully to the instructions of the spiritual master is unfit for chanting or for preaching the cult of devotional service. One has to water the bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja after receiving instructions from the spiritual master.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="151.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="153.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
