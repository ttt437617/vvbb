Only such a devotee is actually completely satisfied and peaceful.'</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>This verse is quoted from &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/6/14/5.htm">6.14.5</A>). The n&#257;r&#257;yana-par&#257;yana, the devotee of Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana, is the only blissful person. One who becomes a n&#257;r&#257;yana-par&#257;yana is already liberated from material bondage. He already possesses all the perfections of yoga. Unless one comes to the platform of n&#257;r&#257;yana-par&#257;yana and passes over the platform of bhukti-mukti-siddhi, he cannot be fully satisfied. That is the pure devotional stage.</P><P>any&#257;bhil&#257;shit&#257;-&#347;&#363;nyam jñ&#257;na-karm&#257;dy-an&#257;vritam</P><P CLASS=n>&#257;nuk&#363;lyena krishn&#257;nu&#347;&#299;lanam bhaktir uttam&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>[Bhakti-ras&#257;mrita-sindhu <A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/brs1/1/11">1.1.11</A>]</P><P>One who desires nothing but Krishna and who is not influenced by the process of jñ&#257;na-m&#257;rga (cultivation of knowledge) actually becomes free from ignorance. A first-class person is one who is not influenced by karma (fruitive activity) or yoga (mystic power). He simply depends on Krishna and is satisfied in his devotional service. According to &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/6/17/28.htm">6.17.28</A>): n&#257;r&#257;yana-par&#257;h sarve na kuta&#347;cana bibhyati. Such a person is never afraid of anything. For him, heaven and hell are the same. Not knowing the situation of a n&#257;r&#257;yana-par&#257;yana, rascals become envious. By the grace of N&#257;r&#257;yana, a devotee is situated in the most opulent position in the material world. Rascals are envious of N&#257;r&#257;yana and His devotee, but the devotee endeavors to please another devotee of N&#257;r&#257;yana because he knows that by pleasing N&#257;r&#257;yana's representative one directly pleases Lord N&#257;r&#257;yana. Therefore a devotee offers the best comforts and facilities to his spiritual master. Outsiders who have no knowledge of N&#257;r&#257;yana are envious of both N&#257;r&#257;yana and His devotee. Consequently when they see that N&#257;r&#257;yana's devotee is opulently situated, they become even more envious. But when the devotee of N&#257;r&#257;yana asks such foolish people to come live with him in the same comfortable situation, they do not agree because they cannot give up illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Therefore the materialist refuses the company of a n&#257;r&#257;yana-par&#257;yana, although he is envious of the devotee's material situation. In Western countries when ordinary men &#8212; storekeepers and workers &#8212; see our devotees living and eating sumptuously and yet not working, they become very eager to know where they get the money. Such people become envious and ask, "How is it possible to live so comfortably without working? How is it you have so many cars, bright faces and nice clothes?" Not knowing that Krishna looks after His devotees, such people become surprised, and some become envious.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="149.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="151.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
