Meeting &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu in a village called R&#257;makeli, two brothers, R&#363;pa and San&#257;tana, began to devise means to get out of their government service. They appointed some br&#257;hmanas to perform pura&#347;carana ceremonies and chant the holy name of Krishna. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; deposited ten thousand gold coins with a grocer, and the balance he brought in two boats to a place called B&#257;kl&#257; Candradv&#299;pa. There he divided this money among the br&#257;hmanas, Vaishnavas and his relatives, and a portion he kept for emergency measures and personal needs. He was informed that &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was going to Vrind&#257;vana from Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299; through the forest of Madhya Pradesh; therefore he sent two people to Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299; to find out when the Lord would leave for Vrind&#257;vana. In this way R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; retired, but San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; told the Nawab that he was sick and could not attend to his work. Giving this excuse, he sat at home and studied &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam with learned br&#257;hmana scholars. The Nawab Hussain Shah first sent his personal physician to see what the real facts were; then he personally came to see why San&#257;tana was not attending to official business. Knowing that he wanted to resign his post, the Nawab had him arrested and imprisoned. The Nawab then went off to attack Orissa.</P><P>When &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu started for Vrind&#257;vana through the forest of Madhya Pradesh (Jh&#257;rikhanda), R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; left home and sent news to San&#257;tana that he was leaving with his younger brother (Anupama Mallika) to meet &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; finally reached Pray&#257;ga and met with &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu for ten successive days. During this time, Vallabha Bhatta extended an invitation to the Lord with great respect. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu introduced &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; to Vallabha Bhatta. After this, a br&#257;hmana scholar named Raghupati Up&#257;dhy&#257;ya arrived and discussed Krishna consciousness with the Lord. Kavir&#257;ja Gosv&#257;m&#299; then extensively describes the living condition of &#346;r&#299; R&#363;pa and San&#257;tana at Vrind&#257;vana. During the ten days at Pray&#257;ga, &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; was instructed by the Lord, who gave him the basic principles of the Bhakti-ras&#257;mrita-sindhu. The Lord then sent &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; to Vrind&#257;vana. The Lord Himself returned to V&#257;r&#257;nas&#299; and stayed at the home of Candra&#347;ekhara.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../18/229.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
