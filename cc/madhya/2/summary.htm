Thus he has also described some of the pastimes of the antya-l&#299;l&#257;. Why he has done so is very difficult for an ordinary person to understand. The author expects that reading the pastimes of the Lord will gradually help a person awaken his dormant love of Krishna. Actually this Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita was compiled by the author during very old age. Fearing he might not be able to finish the book, he has included a synopsis of the antya-l&#299;l&#257; here in the Second Chapter. &#346;r&#299;la Kavir&#257;ja Gosv&#257;m&#299; has confirmed that the opinion of Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara is authoritative in the matter of devotional service. Over and above this are the notes of Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara, memorized by Raghun&#257;tha d&#257;sa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who also helped in the compilation of the Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita. After the disappearance of Svar&#363;pa D&#257;modara Gosv&#257;m&#299;, Raghun&#257;tha d&#257;sa Gosv&#257;m&#299; went to Vrind&#257;vana. At that time the author, &#346;r&#299;la Kavir&#257;ja Gosv&#257;m&#299;, met Raghun&#257;tha d&#257;sa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, by whose mercy he also could memorize all the notes. In this way the author was able to complete this transcendental literature, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya-carit&#257;mrita.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../1/287.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
