The Lord immediately splashed some water on the elephants and asked them to chant the name of Krishna.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing the part of a very great, advanced devotee. On the mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata platform, the devotee makes no distinction between friends and enemies. On that platform he sees everyone as a servant of Krishna. As stated in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/5/18.htm">5.18</A>):</P><P>vidy&#257;-vinaya-sampanne br&#257;hmane gavi hastini</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;uni caiva &#347;va-p&#257;ke ca pandit&#257;h sama-dar&#347;inah</P><P>"The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle br&#257;hmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater [outcaste]."</P><P>A mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata, being learned and advanced in spiritual consciousness, sees no difference between a tiger, an elephant or a learned scholar. The test of advanced spiritual consciousness is that one becomes fearless. He envies no one, and he is always engaged in the Lord's service. He sees every living entity as an eternal part and parcel of the Lord, rendering service according to his capacity by the will of the Supreme Lord. As Krishna confirms in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">15.15</A>):</P><P>sarvasya c&#257;ham hridi sannivishto</P><P CLASS=n>mattah smritir jñ&#257;nam apohanam ca</P><P>"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness."</P><P>The mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata knows that Krishna is in everyone's heart. Krishna is dictating, and the living entity is following His dictations. Krishna is within the heart of the tiger, elephant and boar. Therefore Krishna tells them, "Here is a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata. Please do not disturb him." Why, then, should the animals be envious of such a great personality? Those who are neophytes or even a little progressed in devotional service should not try to imitate the mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata. Rather, they should only follow in his footsteps. The word anukara means "imitating," and anusara means "trying to follow in the footsteps." We should not try to imitate the activities of a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata or &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. Our best efforts should be exerted in trying to follow them according to our ability. The mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata's heart is completely freed from material contamination, and he can become very dear even to fierce animals like tigers and elephants. Indeed, the mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata treats them as his very intimate friends. On this platform there is no question of envy. When the Lord was passing through the forest, He was in ecstasy, thinking the forest to be Vrind&#257;vana. He was simply searching for Krishna.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
