Whatever they say should be accepted as the supreme truth.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In his Amrita-prav&#257;ha-bh&#257;shya, &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda Th&#257;kura gives the following summary of the six philosophical processes. Prak&#257;&#347;&#257;nanda admitted that &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#324;kar&#257;c&#257;rya, being very eager to establish his philosophy of monism, took shelter of the Ved&#257;nta philosophy and tried to explain it in his own way. The fact is, however, that if one accepts the existence of God, one certainly cannot establish the theory of monism. For this reason &#346;a&#324;kar&#257;c&#257;rya refuted all kinds of Vedic literature that establishes the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. In various ways, &#346;a&#324;kar&#257;c&#257;rya has tried to refute the Vedic literature. Throughout the world, ninety-nine percent of the philosophers following in the footsteps of &#346;a&#324;kar&#257;c&#257;rya refuse to accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead they try to establish their own opinions. It is typical of mundane philosophers to want to establish their own opinions and refute those of others. Therefore: (1) The M&#299;m&#257;msaka philosophers, following the principles of Jaimini, stress fruitive activity and say that if there is a God, He must be under the laws of fruitive activity. In other words, if one performs his duties very nicely in the material world, God is obliged to give one the desired result. According to these philosophers, there is no need to become a devotee of God. If one strictly follows moral principles, one will be recognized by the Lord, who will give the desired reward. Such philosophers do not accept the Vedic principle of bhakti-yoga. Instead, they give stress to following one's prescribed duty. (2) Atheistic S&#257;&#324;khya philosophers like Kapila analyze the material elements very scrutinizingly and thereby come to the conclusion that material nature is the cause of everything. They do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the cause of all causes. (3) Ny&#257;ya philosophers like Gautama and Kan&#257;da have accepted a combination of atoms as the original cause of the creation. (4) M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers say that everything is an illusion. Headed by philosophers like Asht&#257;vakra, they stress the impersonal Brahman effulgence as the cause of everything. (5) Philosophers following the precepts of Patañjali practice r&#257;ja-yoga. They imagine a form of the Absolute Truth within many forms. That is their process of self-realization.</P><P>All five of these philosophies completely reject the predominance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and strive to establish their own philosophical theories. However, &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva wrote the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra and, taking the essence of all Vedic literature, established the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All five kinds of philosophers mentioned above understand that impersonal Brahman is without material qualities, and they believe that when the Personality of Godhead appears, He is contaminated and covered by the material qualities. The technical term used is saguna. They speak of saguna Brahman and nirguna Brahman. For them, nirguna Brahman means "the impersonal Absolute Truth without any material qualities" and saguna Brahman means "the Absolute Truth that accepts the contamination of material qualities." More or less, this kind of philosophical speculation is called M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy. The fact is, however, that the Absolute Truth never has anything to do with material qualities because He is transcendental. He is always complete with full spiritual qualities. The five philosophers mentioned above do not accept Lord Vishnu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they are very busy refuting the philosophies of other schools. There are six kinds of philosophical processes in India. Because Vy&#257;sadeva is the Vedic authority, he is known as Vedavy&#257;sa. His philosophical explanation of the Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra is accepted by the devotees. As Krishna confirms in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">15.15</A>):</P><P>sarvasya c&#257;ham hridi sannivishto</P><P CLASS=n>mattah smritir jñ&#257;nam apohanam ca</P><P CLASS=n>vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedyo</P><P CLASS=n>ved&#257;nta-krid veda-vid eva c&#257;ham</P><P>"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known; indeed, I am the compiler of Ved&#257;nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas."</P><P>The ultimate goal of studying all Vedic literature is the acceptance of Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Krishna consciousness movement is propagating the philosophical conclusion of &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva and following other great &#257;c&#257;ryas like R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;c&#257;rya, Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, Vishnu Sv&#257;m&#299;, Nimb&#257;rka and &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu Himself.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="57.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
