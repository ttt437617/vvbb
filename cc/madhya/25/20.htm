With logic and argument He very politely changed their minds.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>We have been spreading this sa&#324;k&#299;rtana movement in the Western countries, and in our recent tour of European cities like Rome, Geneva, Paris and Frankfurt, many learned Christian scholars, priests, philosophers and yog&#299;s came to see us, and by the grace of Krishna they agreed that the Krishna consciousness movement, the bhakti cult, offers the topmost conclusion. Following in the footsteps of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, we are trying to convince everyone that the devotional service of the Lord is enjoined in every scripture. If a person is religious, he must accept the supreme authority of the Lord, become His devotee and try to love Him. This is the real principle of religion. It does not matter whether one is Christian, Muslim or whatever. He simply must accept the sublime position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and render service unto Him. It is not a question of being Christian, Muslim or Hindu. One should be purely religious and freed from all these material designations. In this way one can learn the art of devotional service. This argument appeals to all intelligent men, and consequently the Krishna consciousness movement is gaining ground throughout the world. Due to our solid logic and scientific presentation, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu's prediction that Krishna consciousness will spread to every town and village throughout the world is gradually being realized.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
