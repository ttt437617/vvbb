That is the way of spontaneous love.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Th&#257;kura says that a devotee is attracted by the service of the inhabitants of Vrind&#257;vana &#8212; namely the cowherd men, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nanda, mother Ya&#347;od&#257;, R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299;, the gop&#299;s and the cows and calves. An advanced devotee is attracted by the service rendered by an eternal servitor of the Lord. This attraction is called spontaneous attraction. Technically it is called svar&#363;pa-upalabdhi. This stage is not achieved in the beginning. In the beginning one has to render service strictly according to the regulative principles set forth by the revealed scriptures and the spiritual master. By continuously rendering service through the process of vaidh&#299; bhakti, one's natural inclination is gradually awakened. That is called spontaneous attraction, or r&#257;g&#257;nug&#257; bhakti.</P><P>An advanced devotee situated on the platform of spontaneity is already very expert in &#347;&#257;stric instruction, logic and argument. When he comes to the point of eternal love for Krishna, no one can deviate him from that position, neither by argument nor by &#347;&#257;stric evidence. An advanced devotee has realized his eternal relationship with the Lord, and consequently he does not accept the logic and arguments of others. Such an advanced devotee has nothing to do with the sahajiy&#257;s, who manufacture their own way and commit sins by indulging in illicit sex, intoxication and gambling, if not meat-eating. Sometimes the sahajiy&#257;s imitate advanced devotees and live in their own whimsical way, avoiding the principles set down in the revealed scriptures. Unless one follows the six Gosv&#257;m&#299;s &#8212; &#346;r&#299; R&#363;pa, San&#257;tana, Raghun&#257;tha Bhatta, &#346;r&#299; J&#299;va, Gop&#257;la Bhatta and Raghun&#257;tha d&#257;sa &#8212; one cannot be a bona fide spontaneous lover of Krishna. In this connection, &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa Th&#257;kura says, r&#363;pa-raghun&#257;tha-pade haibe &#257;kuti kabe h&#257;ma bujhaba se yugala pir&#299;ti. The sahajiy&#257;s' understanding of the love affairs between R&#257;dh&#257; and Krishna is not bona fide because they do not follow the principles laid down by the six Gosv&#257;m&#299;s. Their illicit connection and their imitation of the dress of R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, as well as their avoidance of the prescribed methods of revealed scriptures, will lead them to the lowest regions of hell. These imitative sahajiy&#257;s are cheated and unfortunate. They are not equal to advanced devotees (paramahamsas). Debauchees and paramahamsas are not on the same level.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="152.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="154.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
