Par&#299;kshit Mah&#257;r&#257;ja asked &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; why Krishna was so beloved by the residents of Vrind&#257;vana, who loved Him even more than their own offspring or life itself. At that time &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; replied that everyone's &#257;tm&#257;, or soul, is very, very dear, especially to all living entities who have accepted material bodies. But that &#257;tm&#257;, the spirit soul, is part and parcel of Krishna. For this reason, Krishna is very dear to every living entity. Everyone's body is very dear to oneself, and one wants to protect the body by all means because within the body the soul is living. Due to the intimate relationship between the soul and the body, the body is important and dear to everyone. Similarly, the soul, being part and parcel of Krishna, the Supreme Lord, is very, very dear to all living entities. Unfortunately, the soul forgets his constitutional position and thinks he is only the body (deha-&#257;tma-buddhi). Thus the soul is subjected to the rules and regulations of material nature. When a living entity, by his intelligence, reawakens his attraction for Krishna, he can understand that he is not the body but part and parcel of Krishna. Thus filled with knowledge, he no longer labors under attachment to the body and everything related to the body. Janasya moho 'yam aham mameti [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/5/5/8.htm">SB 5.5.8</A>]. Material existence, wherein one thinks, "I am the body, and this belongs to me," is also illusory. One must redirect his attraction to Krishna. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/2/7.htm">1.2.7</A>) states:</P><P>v&#257;sudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogah prayojitah</P><P CLASS=n>janayaty &#257;&#347;u vair&#257;gyam jñ&#257;nam ca yad ahaitukam</P><P>"By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; Krishna, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="161.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="163.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
