Indeed, the meeting between a sanny&#257;s&#299; and a king is always considered abominable. A sanny&#257;s&#299; is always subjected to public criticism, and a small fault on his part is taken seriously by the public. People actually expect a sanny&#257;s&#299; to preach and not take part in any social or political matters. If a sanny&#257;s&#299; is subject to public criticism, his preaching will not be fruitful. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu specifically wanted to avoid such criticism so that His preaching work would not be hampered. It so happened that while the Lord was talking to His disciples at that time, the devotee D&#257;modara Pandita was present. This D&#257;modara Pandita was a very faithful devotee and a staunch lover of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. Whenever there was anything that might touch or taint the character of the Lord, D&#257;modara Pandita would immediately point it out, not even considering the exalted position of the Lord. It is sometimes said that fools rush in where angels dare not, and &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu wanted to point out D&#257;modara Pandita's foolishness in coming forward to criticize the Lord. This is why the Lord stated that if D&#257;modara Pandita would give Him permission, He would go to see the King. There was deep meaning in this statement, for it is a warning that D&#257;modara should not dare criticize the Lord any more, for it was not befitting his position as a devotee. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was considered the guide and spiritual master of all the devotees living with Him. D&#257;modara Pandita was one of them, and the Lord rendered D&#257;modara Pandita a special favor by warning him to avoid criticizing Him any further. A devotee or a disciple should never attempt to criticize the Lord or His representative, the spiritual master.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
