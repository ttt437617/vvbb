That platform is called vi&#347;uddha-sattva (sattvam vi&#347;uddham vasudeva-&#347;abditam). Realization of the vi&#347;uddha-sattva platform is beyond the pale of the material world and is not perceived by bodily senses or mental speculation. Our identification with the gross body and subtle mind is different from spiritual understanding. Since the intelligence and mind are material, the loving affairs of &#346;r&#299; R&#257;dh&#257; and Krishna are beyond their perception. Sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam: [Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/19/170.htm">Madhya 19.170</A>] when we are free from all material designations and our senses are completely purified by the bhakti process, we can understand the sense activities of the Absolute Truth (hrish&#299;kena hrish&#299;ke&#347;a-sevanam bhaktir ucyate [Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/19/170.htm">Madhya 19.170</A>]).</P><P>The spiritual senses are beyond the material senses. A materialist can think only of the negation of material variety; he cannot understand spiritual variety. He thinks that spiritual variety simply contradicts material variety and is a negation or void, but such conceptions cannot even reach the precincts of spiritual realization. The wonderful activities of the gross body and subtle mind are always imperfect. They are below the degree of spiritual understanding and are ephemeral. The spiritual mellow is eternally wonderful and is described as p&#363;rna, &#347;uddha, nitya-mukta &#8212; that is, complete, perfectly pure and eternally liberated from all material conceptions. When we are unable to fulfill our material desires, there is certainly sorrow and confusion. This may be described as vivarta. But in spiritual life there is no sorrow, inebriety or imperfection. &#346;r&#299;la R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya was expert in realizing the spiritual activities of &#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#299; and Krishna, and R&#257;m&#257;nanda's spiritual experience was placed before &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu as he inquired whether the Lord approved his realization of spiritual truth.</P><P>There are three books prominent in this connection. One was written by Bhakta d&#257;sa B&#257;ula and is called Vivarta-vil&#257;sa. Another was compiled by Jagad&#257;nanda Pandita and is called Prema-vivarta. &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya's book is called Prema-vil&#257;sa-vivarta. The Vivarta-vil&#257;sa by Bhakta d&#257;sa B&#257;ula is completely different from the other two books. Sometimes a university student or professor tries to study these transcendental literatures and attempts to put forth a critical analysis from the mundane view, with an end to receiving degrees like a Ph.D. Such realization is certainly different from that of R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya. If one actually wants to take a Ph.D. degree from &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and be approved by R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya, he must first become free from all material designations (sarvop&#257;dhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam [Cc. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../cc/madhya/19/170.htm">Madhya 19.170</A>]). A person who identifies with his material body cannot understand these talks between &#346;r&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya and &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. Man-made religious scriptures and transcendental philosophical talks are quite different. Indeed, there is a gulf of difference between the two. This subject matter has been very diligently described by &#346;r&#299;man Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya. Since material philosophers are situated in the material conception of life, they are unable to realize the spiritual prema-vil&#257;sa-vivarta. They cannot accommodate an elephant upon a dish. Similarly, mundane speculators cannot capture the spiritual elephant within their limited conception. It is just like a frog's trying to measure the Atlantic Ocean by imagining it so many times larger than his well. Materialistic philosophers and sahajiy&#257;s cannot understand the talks between R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya and &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu concerning the pastimes of &#346;r&#299; R&#257;dh&#257; and Krishna. The only tendency of the impersonalists or the pr&#257;krita-sahajiy&#257;s is to face the platform of impersonalism. They cannot understand spiritual variegatedness. Consequently, when R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya attempted to sing his own verses, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu stopped him by covering his mouth with His own hand.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="192.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="194.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
