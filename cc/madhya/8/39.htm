Therefore they go to people's houses, although they have no personal business there.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>A sanny&#257;s&#299; is supposed to beg from door to door. He does not beg simply because he is hungry. His real purpose is to enlighten the occupant of every house by preaching Krishna consciousness. A sanny&#257;s&#299; does not abandon his superior position and become a beggar just for the sake of begging. Similarly, a person in householder life may be very important, but he may also voluntarily take to the mendicant way of life. R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; and San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; were ministers, but they voluntarily accepted the mendicant's life in order to humbly preach &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu's message. It is said about them: tyaktv&#257; t&#363;rnam a&#347;esha-mandala-pati-&#347;ren&#299;m sad&#257; tuccha-vat bh&#363;tv&#257; d&#299;na-gane&#347;akau karunay&#257; kaup&#299;na-kanth&#257;&#347;ritau. Although the Gosv&#257;m&#299;s were very aristocratic, on the order of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu they became mendicants just to deliver the fallen souls. One should also consider that those who engage in the missionary activities of the Krishna consciousness movement are under the guidance of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. They are not actually beggars; their real business is to deliver fallen souls. Therefore they may go from door to door just to introduce a book about Krishna consciousness so that people can become enlightened by reading. Formerly brahmac&#257;r&#299;s and sanny&#257;s&#299;s used to beg from door to door. At the present moment, especially in the Western countries, a person may be handed over to the police if he begs from door to door. In Western countries, begging is considered criminal. Members of the Krishna consciousness movement have no business begging. Instead, they work very hard to introduce some literatures about Krishna consciousness so that people can read them and be benefited. But if one gives some contribution to a Krishna conscious man, he never refuses it.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="38.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="40.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
