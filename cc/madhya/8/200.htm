This is very mysterious. Anyway, kindly hear the explanation of the process by which the goal can be attained.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; has advised us to hear about Krishna from a Vaishnava. He has explicitly forbidden us to hear from an avaishnava.</P><P>avaishnava-mukhodg&#299;rnam p&#363;tam hari-kath&#257;mritam</P><P CLASS=n>&#347;ravanam naiva kartavyam sarpocchishtam yath&#257; payah</P><P>Thus quoting from Padma Pur&#257;na, &#346;r&#299;la San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; warns that one should not hear anything about Krishna from an avaishnava, however great a mundane scholar he may be. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects; similarly, talks about Krishna given by an avaishnava are also poisonous. However, because a Vaishnava is surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his talks are spiritually potent. In the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/10.htm">10.10</A>) the Supreme Lord says:</P><P>tesh&#257;m satata-yukt&#257;n&#257;m bhajat&#257;m pr&#299;ti-p&#363;rvakam</P><P CLASS=n>dad&#257;mi buddhi-yogam tam yena m&#257;m upay&#257;nti te</P><P>"To those who are constantly devoted to worshiping Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me." When a pure Vaishnava speaks, he speaks perfectly. How is this? His speech is managed by Krishna Himself from within the heart. &#346;r&#299;la R&#257;m&#257;nanda R&#257;ya accepts this benediction from &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu; therefore he admits that whatever he was speaking was not derived from his own intelligence. Rather, everything was coming from &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. According to the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">15.15</A>):</P><P>sarvasya c&#257;ham hridi sannivishto</P><P CLASS=n>mattah smritir jñ&#257;nam apohanam ca</P><P CLASS=n>vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedyo</P><P CLASS=n>ved&#257;nta-krid veda-vid eva c&#257;ham</P><P>"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed I am the compiler of the Ved&#257;nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas."</P><P>All intelligence emanates from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul within the heart of everyone. Nondevotees want to ask the Supreme Lord for sense gratification; therefore nondevotees come under the influence of m&#257;y&#257;, the illusory energy. A devotee, however, is directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes under the influence of yogam&#257;y&#257;. Consequently there is a gulf of difference between statements made by a devotee and those made by a nondevotee.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="199.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="201.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
