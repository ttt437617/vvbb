Gop&#299;n&#257;tha has stolen this pot of sweet rice for you!"</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The difference between the Absolute Truth and relative truth is explained here. Lord Gop&#299;n&#257;tha has openly declared herein that He is a thief. He had stolen the pot of sweet rice, and this was not kept a secret because His act of stealing is a source of great transcendental bliss. In the material world, theft is criminal, but in the spiritual world the Lord's stealing is a source of transcendental bliss. Mundane rascals, who cannot understand the absolute nature of the Personality of Godhead, sometimes call Lord &#346;r&#299; Krishna immoral, but they do not know that His seemingly immoral activities, which are not kept secret, afford pleasure to the devotees. Not understanding the transcendental behavior of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, these rascals slur His character and immediately fall into the category of miscreants (rascals, lowest among men, demons and those whose knowledge is taken away by the illusory energy). Krishna explains in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/15.htm">7.15</A>):</P><P>na m&#257;m dushkritino m&#363;dh&#257;h prapadyante nar&#257;dham&#257;h</P><P CLASS=n>m&#257;yay&#257;pahrita-jñ&#257;n&#257; &#257;suram bh&#257;vam &#257;&#347;rit&#257;h</P><P>"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, who are lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons do not surrender unto Me." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/15.htm">Bg. 7.15</A>)</P><P>Mundane rascals cannot understand that whatever Krishna does, being absolute in nature, is all-good. This quality of the Lord is explained in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/10/33/29.htm">10.33.29</A>). One may consider certain acts of a supremely powerful person to be immoral by mundane calculations, but this is not actually the case. For example, the sun absorbs water from the surface of the earth, but it does not absorb water only from the sea. It also absorbs water from filthy sewers and ditches containing urine and other impure substances. The sun is not polluted by absorbing such water. Rather, the sun makes the filthy place pure. If a devotee approaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead for an immoral or improper purpose, he nonetheless becomes purified; the Lord does not become infected. In &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/10/29/15.htm">10.29.15</A>) it is stated that if one approaches the Supreme Lord even out of lust, anger or fear (k&#257;mam krodham bhayam), he is purified. The gop&#299;s, being young girls, approached Krishna because He was a beautiful young boy. From the external point of view, they approached the Lord out of lust, and the Lord danced with them at midnight. From the mundane point of view, these activities may appear immoral because a married or unmarried young girl cannot leave home to mix with a young boy and dance with him. Although this is immoral from the mundane viewpoint, the activities of the gop&#299;s are accepted as the highest form of worship because it was Lord Krishna whom they approached with lusty desires in the dead of night.</P><P>But these things cannot be understood by nondevotees. One must understand Krishna in tattva (truth). One should use his common sense and consider that if simply by chanting Krishna's holy name one is purified, how then can the person Krishna be immoral? Unfortunately, mundane fools are accepted as educational leaders and are offered exalted posts for teaching irreligious principles to the general populace. This is explained in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/7/5/31.htm">7.5.31</A>): andh&#257; yath&#257;ndhair upan&#299;yam&#257;n&#257;h. Blind men are trying to lead other blind men. Due to the immature understanding of such rascals, common men should not discuss Krishna's pastimes with the gop&#299;s. A nondevotee should not even discuss His stealing sweet rice for His devotees. It is warned that one should not even think about these things. Although Krishna is the purest of the pure, mundane people, thinking of Krishna's pastimes that appear immoral, themselves become polluted. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore never publicly discussed Krishna's dealings with the gop&#299;s. He used to discuss these dealings only with three confidential friends. He never discussed r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257; publicly, as the professional reciters do, although they do not understand Krishna or the nature of the audience. However, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu encouraged the public chanting of the holy name on a huge scale for as many hours as possible.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="132.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="134.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=797"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright © The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
